Pats:;Despite their poor reviews on Yelp for being over priced, less than spectacular, and staffed by greasy men with the unique streak of arrogance borne of notoriety, we felt that experiencing the origins of the \\'steak would be more rewarding than tracking down steakeries more highly regarded by the on-line community. ;;So off to South Philly we ventured. We had been warned by other steak hunters that the area inhabited by the legendary steakeries was dilapidated and dangerous- so we were happily surprised to find them located in a vibrant community reminiscent of the San Francisco Mission (except with a lot less Latinos and a lot more Italians.) ;;Arriving unmolested, we broke into teams to procure steaks from each of the shops (without out having to stand in both the long winding lines sequentially.) Our team went to Geno\\'s, while Priscilla, Tammy and Sam went to Pat\\'s to pick up our steaks. ;Geno\\'s was interestingly decorated in photo\\'s of the owner and his son posing with scantily-clad, skanky looking women and various celebs, as well as over the top pro-American propaganda and anti-immigrant rhetoric. ;;I was warned by a woman in line that I must order our steaks with the whiz. Apparently it caused quite an uproar when John Kerry failed to order the traditional \"South Philly,\" from Geno\\'s- note that Pat\\'s doesn\\'t serve the whiz, so apparently the style only represents the north corner of the intersection, rather than all of South Philly.;;When I returned to our seats, team 2 had already procured our steaks from Pats. Apparently some confusion had occurred during ordering, and we now had in our possession 7 steaks- 4 from Pats, and 3 from Genos. ;;Both steaks were pretty basic- thin strips of steak with onions on bland French rolls; Pat\\'s came with the traditional Provolone and Geno\\'s with the aforementioned Cheese Whiz.;;I started by eating one half of a Pat\\'s steak. It was decent, but uninspiring. Several members of the expedition complained that Pat\\'s Steaks were too dry. While not overly moist, I didn\\'t share their concern; however the flavor was lacking in my opinion. Pat\\'s Steaks were very bland in flavor, reminding me of my own creations before I got down with Montreal seasoning and fresh garlic. The cheese was also lacking in flavor. ;;Next, I moved onto a Geno\\'s steak, with the Whiz. I was intrigued by the flavor and consistency of the Whiz; the steak was juicier than Pat\\'s and the Whiz and grease mixed into thin cheese-gravy that soaked the otherwise bland roll. The meat was similarly bland to that of Pat\\'s, but the flavor of the Whiz compensated for the most part. ;;I ended up consuming about 2.5-3 steaks in various portions in the sitting, as a excess had been ordered and various members of the expedition were unable to complete their missions, so I feel that I am qualified to end the age old debate as to who makes the best Cheese Steak:;;Consensus amongst the group was that Geno\\'s made the better steak of the two, but Geno\\'s lost points due to the quasi-racist vibe, and at least 1 member of the expedition didn\\'t care much for the Whiz. If we had spent more than a single night in Philly, we would have undoubtedly searched for less famous, but more delectable competition, but unfortunately we left the City of Brotherly love disappointed by the over-hyped, over-rated \\'steaks. ;;;Mike\\'s Ratings: (On a scale from 1-5, 5 being perfect and 1 being inedible.);;;Cheese Steak Shop: 4.5-5 (Great tasting, but pretty expensive. I require a 15\\' to fully satisfy my hunger);Geno\\'s: 3-3.5 (Tasty, also too damn expensive) ;Pat\\'s: 2.5-3 (Very bland, I can do better at home.);;;Vanessa\\'s Ratings:;Cheese Steak Shop: 5 (\"Yummy!\");Geno\\'s: 3.5 (\"I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to stand in that line & he\\'s racist.\");Pat\\'s: 2 (\"It was too dry.\")', 'user_id': 'a8wKua129w25q4wtP26p2g'}\n",

They do every aspect of a restaurant experience right. The servers are all really friendly, and explain what every item is for those of us who's only experience with Israeli food is Zahav. The bartenders treat you like family and take great care of you when dining at the bar. Chris, who was waiting on us from behind the bar last night, was tremendous.

Never enjoyed one as much as these. Nice little kick of heat in them as well.;-The grilled Haloumi. This cheese, if you haven't tried it, is a game changer.

I did a last minute trip to Philly and did not really have time to do extensive research. Shame on me.;Luckily, my friends told me about Zahav as I was riding the Amtrak to Philly. I immediately went on OpenTable to book a seat for 1. Surely I could get a table for 1. Well.. nope. The restaurant was full. I looked at a bunch of Yelp reviews and learned that you had to book this restaurant 3 months in advance.  ;Well, I decided to walk in and try my luck. After all, Anthony Bourdain did eat here and it is one of my life goals to eat at all the restaurants that he has eaten at.;As soon as I checked into my hotel, I wasted no time in heading to Zahav. I got to the restaurant around 6:30pm and saw a lot of people waiting. Oh no... would I have to wait too? Well, the host led me straight to the bar where there was an open seat. I felt as if I had just won the jackpot!;I settled in my seat and ordered a glass of wine. The bartender that took care of me was absolutely fantastic! I was sitting next to some awkward dude who was eating alone, and we happened to order the same thing. He happened to order before me so his food would come out first, then mine would come out 10 min later, and they were quite similar. I promise I wasn\\'t copying him!;I\\'ve never had Israeli cousins before, the only thing I knew was that I would not eat pork. That was the extent of my knowledge. The bartender suggested that I do the \"taste of zahav\", which consists of a 4 course meal, with multiple dishes in each course. He suggested that I should take it easy on the appetizers, so that I could focus on eating the main course. After all, the appetizers were  easily packable to bring home. The course cost $48, and is a great way to taste everything. You can also do wine paring for an additional $36. Let\\'s dive into each course:;Course #1: salatim & hummus with laffa. Salatim means salads- you get 6 different small salads such as cabbage salad, eggplant salad, green bean salad etc. These were good. The hummus was amazing, there are 3 types to choose from. I had the daily hummus, which had some chicken in it. The bread that comes with the hummus is AMAZING. I almost died. It was so soft and pillowy and fluffy.... Yum. I had a really hard time not eating the whole bread, because I needed to save space for the rest of the courses. ;Course #2: 2 mezze. You can pick 2 small dishes from the menu. I picked the fried cauliflower and haloumi. The dark hearts are quite a popular dish, the guy next to me had it... I am not a fan of eating hearts but if you like hearts, I hear its good here. Both dishes were good. The haloumi was amazing, it came with blueberries and pistachio, which sounds like a weird combination, but actually tasted fantastic. ;Course #3: Al Ha\\'esh- grilled dish over coals. I had the grilled branzino. To be honest, I was quite full at this point but ate the whole thing. The skin was nice and crispy, the fish was soft and tender.;Course #4: Desert. I had grilled peach with sherbert, and za\\'atar shortbread.  The shortbread had a nice twice to it, it tasted different from Walkers\\' shortbread. ;The waiter packed all my leftovers for me in separate containers... which I ate that night before going to bed. ;I had a wonderful experience here and can\\'t wait to come back. Remember, if you walk in by yourself, you might score a seat at the bar with minimal wait! Or else, make your reservation exactly 3 months in advance!', 'user_id': 'FC1ZSB9fd4WlDMSAbEjq8Q'}\n",

My friend and I are both students, and normally are given crappy service as a result. At Zahav, the waiter could not have been more patient, explaining each menu item and its flavors. The owner came over in the middle of our meal to ask how it was going as well as at the end of the meal to make sure we had had a great meal. Our meal was the definition of relaxed comfort-I described the atmosphere to one of my friends as 'like a neighborhood place'.;;In terms of highlights, the salatim definitely stands out as a can't miss; a large selection of tasty small dishes. There wasn't a bad dish among the ones we had, each unique and full of flavor. My friend basically devoured the hummus, so I have to assume it was good. The potato latke with salmon was also great; it's the kind of dish that you're sad when it's over because it was that good. The duck kebab kind of looked like a 'duck hamburger' in a small patty; I didn't taste the pistachios in it but it still tasted great.;;Perhaps the only not amazing part (of which the service more than makes up for) was the dessert. The pistachio cookie of my caramel semifreddo was very tough, although the flavors were good. my friend had the baklava and didn't like it as much as the regular dishes. ;;All in all, I would gladly pay non-RW prices; it was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to come back soon.\", 'user_id': 'cR5bvpc0xeQpm-Bsx67A8w'}\n",

Noise level is almost perfect in today's noisy way: restaurants seem to strive for a high noise level that grants intimacy to your conversation, it's too hard for you to hear each other let alone for others to hear you. At Barbuzzo, We could easily hear each other and the table next to us, and after that, it's all loud white noise. Not complaining, it was actually good. Only complaint: the place is so dark, and the table candles so tiny, that both of us had to use our iPhone flashlights in order to read the menu. ;We reserved through OpenTable and were seated immediately. We saw delicious looking pizzas on other tables, and despite both of us trying NOT to eat pizza, we had to try it. Thank goodness we did! We got the simple Margherita pizza, which really shows off a restaurant's ability, and show it did. Amazing. Scrumptious. Perfect crust: crispy, chewy, flavorful. Like few others. Burnt in a good way obviously made in a very hot oven (wood fired?).;Beer and wine selection outstanding, someone obviously put love and attention into this. A wine special was an Austrian red, which my wife had: delicious. I had a Sierra Nevada pilsner, again, amazing. Both of us immediately thought of the delicious beers we enjoyed in Netherlands and Germany that tasted so different (and better) than what we get here in the US, and this had that same distinct wonderful fresh flavorful taste.;I got a burrata salad (grilled heirloom carrot, pickled rainbow chard, arugula paesto, marcona almonds), amazing, and unlike anything I've had.

We had to flag him down and when he brought silverware it was only for three settings not four, so again we had to wait to all start digging in.

So for the rest of this review I will refer to it as \"The Dandy Lion Pub\". Which I find to be so much more pleasing than a bar named after a weed that I don\\'t even think exists in England...;;I have a tip for anyone trying to get into this place: that super cool door on the corner of 18th and Sansom? Not the actual door.  I felt like a fool tugging on it, only to find out the real door looks like a side entrance on 18th.  Anyways, the decor in the Dandy Lion was somewhat odd, but enjoyable. As I waited for my friends to arrive, I sat near the fireplace in what felt like some old man\\'s living room. I was afraid to touch anything until someone on the staff came over and told me it actually was for sitting not just looking (it resembles the random furniture you see thrown into some museums, with ropes in front of the display telling you not to sit). Side note: the staff here is fantastic: super nice, helpful, and very cheerful but laid back. We sat upstairs in a very homey feeling sun room which i just loved.  I could sit up there all day. ;;I came here for brunch and was really pleased with the menu. I find most brunch menus to be very overwhelming, with way too many options. There was a nice range of choices but not so much that I couldn\\'t choose a meal. I went for the Eggs Royale and they were fantastic. Just the right amount of Hollandaise and smoked salmon, and really well cooked eggs. The coffee was really delicious but heads up, its like $3.50 (a bit steep if you ask me). ;;Also, the bar area looks lovely.

It feels really intimate in each space, which has its own design and layout.  I believe that this is pretty authentic based on my one trip to the UK a few years ago.  But honestly - knowing that Great Britain is not exactly known for its food - the ambiance is the only thing that this place has in common with its inspiration!  But I digress.  Major ambiance highlights include wood-burning fireplaces, which are a treasure during winter months, and the dog bar upstairs, with tons of photos and statues of dogs.  The furniture is all old-school - lots of wood, wooden tables, chairs and paneling.  Check out the room upstairs painted in off-white with a bay window overlooking 18th street and a beautiful light fixture...it looked very appealing and warm in there.;;The food was great and the service was very friendly and welcoming.  It was crowded in there but they sat us within 20 minutes or so (no problem, I rocked some Pinot Noir while we waited).  PS - looks like a fun beer selection here.;;Here's what we ordered:;;-deviled eggs - nice curry flavor, but not overpowering at all.  MMM!;;-butter lettuce salad - lightly dressed with apples, bleu cheese, pomergranite seeds...why is butter lettuce so good?;;-fois gras - I don't usually order it.  Came with an egg, thick-cut bacon and balsamic reduction = one tasty bite!;;-NY Strip - OUT OF CONTROL GOOD...comes with two sauces, one was a little creamy and one was a rich bbq-esque flavor.

That is all I have to say.;;-Roasted organic chicken - I don't usually order chicken out but this is the place to get it...came on potatoes, I caught a taste of turnips, roasted baby carrots...simple, delicious, hearty.;;Next snow day you can find me at the fireplace in Dandelion.\", 'user_id': 'UR5I5oboRkjVwNjUwFdZPg'}\n",

They also have dry noodles but I think the soup is better. The proportions are HUGE so it's hard to even come close to finishing it. On top of that, it's SO cheap. If you're feeling adventurous, I would also recommend starting with the beef tendon on top of pickled radish. ;;This place is a must try and worth the trip (from NY) to Philly. It's THAT good.\", 'user_id': '17nie4O8VlC-PFZo_gaRfw'}\n",

Plenty of accompanying fruits and crackers that only enhance the experience, and the staff does a great job explaining each cheese when plating.;;I would recommend getting two of the smaller plates rather than one main course since they're about half the price, more than half the size and this allows you to try as many things as possible.

The broth was thick, creamy and rich without causing that bloated aftertaste. The noodles were perfectly cooked, Hakata-style I believe, thin straight noodles. The pork was a little different from the usual chewy, thin slices of char siu - this was thicker, fattier, and tasted much softer. I liked it, though! It melted in my mouth.

Came in and ordered a large spicy miso ramen ($9) after about a 30 minute wait on a Saturday night at 5pm.  The ramen took a considerable amount of time to make, about 15 minutes, but I\\'ll forgive them since their waitress was super nice and because they were obviously swamped with orders.  But anyways, about the ramen.  ;;For me, ramen can be broken down into 4 components: broth, meat, noodles, toppings.  The broth was a really rich flavor... almost too rich if that\\'s possible.  It tasted like it had been simmered for half a day if not longer, but maybe it was because of that that it felt like there was a certain freshness missing from it.  Perhaps it would have benefitted from a drizzle of sesame oil or truffle oil on top, to give the broth an extra aromatic oomph and flavor.  As is, it just tasted a bit too overpoweringly of pork and miso.  The meat was absolutely fantastic.  The meat was barely holding together with my chopsticks and even less so when I bit into it.  Had a good amount of fat that further added to its texture.  Flavor was also a bit strong, but overall not too bad since the meat is meant to be paired with the more \"bland\" items like rice or in this case noodle.  Speaking of noodles, these noodles were all right, nothing really to rave about but definitely adequate for a ramen place.  The toppings similarly were all right and nothing to rave about.  Had some bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, half an egg, and some of that asian black fungus in strips.  A boring composition, which kind of felt like it was thrown together to provide asthetic appeal to the dish.  The egg was well made however, and the bamboo shoots weren\\'t too bad either.  ;;Overall, pretty decent place I will almost definitely venture to again when I have a craving for ramen, but not a place I\\'d glowingly recommend as the single ramen culinary experience that my friend had made it seem to be.', 'user_id': 'sxJSvauDFXGn-hSxt9G1yA'}\n",

The atmosphere is quaint and unpretentious like other more well-known Philly steak joints.

However, by and large, the customers in line are comprised of city workers, dock workers, white collar suits, and people from the neighborhood.;;And that's what you get treated like here -- like you're from the neighborhood.  The family and crew that run this multi-generational shop treat you as if you were a member of the family.  I have never had a bad experience at Johns, and I have been here probably 20-30 times since last summer.;;All items are made per order.  There's no 10 lbs. of precooked meat on the grill here.  That being stated, be prepared to wait if there is a line ahead of you.  It's worth it though.  My favorite is a mushroom steak with grilled onions and sharp.  Grab a drink and some Tastykake Krimpets for deserts, and you're all set!;;Not in the mood for a steak or just don't want to wait?  No problem.  Skip the line and go for the namesake, the roast pork sandwich.  Heaven!  It's marinated in a special recipe, and you get lots of it.  Like the cheesesteak, the large roast pork is served on a long roll with sesame seeds.  Too good for words.  Or go for breakfast and get a scrapple and egg sandwich.;;The only downside is the hours of operation.  It makes it a bit cumbersome sometimes.

I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn\\'t quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.;;When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can\\'t wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.;;Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. ;;All in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable.

My fiance had tried their donuts before and had told me that they were rich and cakey - too much so to be able to finish a whole donut. I didn't believe him until I tried them myself, and he's right (for once, ha!). I would feel sick not long after eating one. As for the flavors, they're pretty good...when I could taste them. The cakiness masks many of the flavors, especially the sugary ones like the strawberry (seriously, there was NO fennel flavor), but glazed flavors like the PBJ were more pronounced, although I did not find that one spicy, and I could barely get a taste of bacon on the other one, which is a travesty since bacon flavor overpowers almost everything!;;Next up, I've gotta try the fried chicken - in all it's incarnations - but why is it so impossible to buy before it sells out?!

The manager came out and told us it was the chef\\'s rule, \"for our own good and the good of our experience\" because it would be so hard for us to when to eat what if some people didn\\'t have food in front of them. Stupid, but tolerable. And the priced fix options had $ next to them, so since they could be purchased a la carte, we got over it.

The butcher salad was crisp and flavorful but nothing to write home about. I got the 12 oz filet mignon medium well but I would recommend going medium or rarer. Regardless it was still delicious. I preferred my boyfriend's dry aged porterhouse (very rare) which was probably the best steak he ever had. The random greens on the side seemed to be more for color on the plate than anything, but I think they should remove this altogether. The mushrooms and onions were so tasty, I wanted the recipe. The stuffed hash brown was impressive but heavily dairy based and the crispy edges were my favorite. We finished our meal with a baked alaska which was as delicious as everyone promised.

We were seated on the first floor fairly quickly and near the open door/windows for a nice, airy dinner.  As we sat, the busboy came over and filled our water glasses.  However, the server was nowhere to be seen...  After about 20 minutes, and 2 or 3 glasses of water, we were greeted by our server. ;;More often than not, once a server notices you, things are generally smooth sailing...not this time. It took 20 more minutes for our margaritas to arrive, and another 10-15  minutes after that for our appetizers to arrive. Our server did not check on us. (He was actually cleaning the air ducts with a stick and a towel on the end of the stick, which was thankfully not near our table.) We'd now been seated for about an hour, and only gotten to our appetizers. ;;All in all, food was OK. ;House Margaritas not great. ;Service was downright horrendous.  ;;Let's hope this place gets it together or I won't be back.\", 'user_id': 'T2ZdQyjldypu4xPQJRDblQ'}\n",

The very first thing I had to have was coffee with cream, or \"cafe con leche\". The coffee was excellent, and gave me a nice boost throughout the day. For brunch, I had to go with the heuvos rancheros, considering we were at a Latin inspired restaurant. The eggs came with a creole sauce, refried beans, tortilla chips, and I choose chorizo (one of like 4 meat options). ;;The eggs were very good, and definitely kicked up a notch with the creole sauce on top. The chorizo was also enjoyable to. But I found the tortilla chips to be the best part of the dish! They were so fresh and crunchy, clearly these were made in house. I found the best way to eat this dish was to top a chip with some eggs, beans, and a little piece of chorizo, a great combo overall!

The food is fine, the interior is fine, and the selection is fine - everything was just fine. Nothing stood out to be particularly, but nothing was terrible (except 1 thing we ordered as I'll explain below).;;So, my friend and I got the AYCE BBQ (you can also do Hotpot as well but we did not opt to do so). The food is cooked in front of you by someone who comes by / sticks around for a long time (did we feel kinda weird that our conversations were pretty personal? a bit) - but she was real nice and didn't really seem to care about what we were saying. The food cooks on what i THINK is an infrared system, so there's no real fire. That makes for 1. less smoke (and therefore your clothes dont smell like food TOO much) and 2. a weird, non-charred cook, which I personally like on bbq.;;Well, the house steak and short ribs were both great. The short ribs were a bit too fatty for my liking - if there was a real fire maybe this would have rendered a bit more and have been actually somewhat marginally appetizing, but alas it was not. My friend who was a complete noob with chopsticks also had a hard time eating this. The curried chicken breast was not something I would ever recommend. Tasted TOO much like cumin. Like just cumin. mmm. no good.;;You can also make your own sauce - I just did equal parts soy sauce, garlic and sesame oil and it was great.;;Overall, this place is a great place that you should DEFINITELY try.

We asked that the garlic bread come out when it was was ready however this ended up being at the same time as our entrees.

I hear some flavors are spiked, which I'm really excited to try. If it weren't so cold outside, I would have been compelled to clean out this entire gelato section myself.

However, both were heavenly and well-balanced in both flavor and texture.

When my friend finally arrived; the hostess asked us to wait at the bar while our table was prepared (again; 400 open seats)...... once we were seated; experience was also just ok.  Space is still beautiful; but seemed a little tired (maybe it was just the staff at the tail end of a slow night that made it feel that way).  The food was ok (calamari was a little smaller serving than I remembered and a little dry); beef carpaccio was good; Caesar salad just ok- they were out of the Crab Cake which was really too bad as I was looking forward to it.   We shared the Rib eye and it was well prepared.  Having another server cleaning and moving tables right next to us for a sustained period while we ate was a bit distracting; but not the end of the world (again; my fault for going so late).   They were also out of the corn side dish which I remember being delicious so I was again; disappointed.   I can't help but feel like a place of this level and price gets less leeway when it comes to being properly stocked up; i.e.; don't run out of stuff.  Finally; and this is a personal thing- the crowd was not what I remembered.  Again; there weren't many; but the customers there were very sloppy looking and very poorly dressed.

One thing I enjoyed in regards to the broth is that they actually refill your pot with the actual broth you ordered instead of a standard veggie or chicken broth like most places.; ;Since we were unsure of which cut of meat to get, we decided to try the sampler. Favorite off of this was definitely the wagu. Next time we come, that's probably what we will mostly be ordering. It was so buttery and melt in your mouth delicious.;;We were seated at a table that didn't have a family sharing pot, so that was a bit difficult. They stated that they normally save those tables for larger parties of 6 or more. We didn't use 2 of the stove tops, so I do recommend them getting something to cover it so it could be used as extra table space. The table was a tad cramped, but it didn't stop us from enjoying our time there.;;I can't wait to come back and actually try some of their other specialties.\", 'user_id': 'OmL2bjLvvRxg1brM5Pehgw'}\n",

We ordered 2 of these deals:;;1) Crispy Spinach Chaat and Lollipop Lamb Chops:  The chaat and lamb chops were excellent.  The spinach was crispy and the sauce coating the spinach was a perfect balance of tangy and sweet.  The lamb was soft and had nice marination.  I am biased towards Lamb sourced from New Zealand and when I see those magic words on the menu card of a restaurant, I can't help but order the dish.  The only complaint with lamb chops was that they were smaller than I've eaten in other comparable restaurants.  Now, I also have to add that price at IndeBlue for this dish was lower than the other restaurants.  So, I guess, you pay less and you get less.  ;;2) Drums of heaven and Malai Kofta Bukhara:  Drums of heaven were cooked perfectly and were big in size.  I would have liked them more if they were spicier and not so sweet.  Malai Kofta was excellent.  The gravy had lot of flavor, the koftas were soft and tasty.;;I would rate the food 4.75/5.;;Service was exactly what I expect when I eat out.  The timing between the courses was perfect, the temperature of the food was hot when served, the plating of the food was good, the utensils were clean, the hostess was polite, the server asked if we were done before removing the empty plates.

As a generally picky customer when it comes to food, atmosphere, price, and portion-size, I'm happy to say that El Rey hits all of my personal preferences perfectly.;;First, the location is fantastic.  It's right off Rittenhouse Square easily accessible from most Center City offices, public transportation, and hotels making working dinners or dates very easy.  The decor is quite obviously Starr-esque in that it's contrived, but obviously so, but it creates a very casual, current vibe that is welcome.  I've never felt out of place wearing shorts and a t-shirt here or coming right after work in a tie.;;Second, the food is fresh and good.  The portions are pitch-perfect in that they do not leave you feeling overly full but sated, though I would suggest indulging in the nachos prior to the entree if you are particularly hungry as the tacos (quite good!) are somewhat limited in their size, and even the enchiladas (also quite good with shredded chicken or beef!) won't lay heavily in your gut.;;Finally, the prices are obscenely reasonable for a Center City restaurant of this style.  I've never had a dinner (including a glass or two of wine with a friend, two entrees, and an order of the nachos or chips and salsa) exceeding $50 (including 20%+ gratuity!)  The staff is always attentive, friendly (but not in a fake sense), and the place is always busy (but not in an obnoxious way.);;If you are looking for something new along Chestnut (somewhat off the beaten path for those of us living in Center City!), definitely give El Rey a chance.

It was a delicious meal at a great price and we will definitely be back.  My craving for pasta hit around lunchtime on Saturday, and I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get a reservation for that night - albeit at 9:30.  We drooled over the online menu, picked up a nice bottle of red and were seated promptly when we arrived for our reservation.  Service throughout the evening was very friendly.  There were a few minor delays, but the restaurant was legitimately packed.;;We started our meal by sharing the BLT salad, which was comprised of baby arugula, tomatoes, crispy pancetta and shaved parmesan nicely complemented by an appropriate amount of limoncello vinaigrette.  They split the salad onto two plates in the kitchen, which is always a nice touch.  For entrees the husband had a pork loin special with spinach and roasted potatoes in a white wine sauce while I had a pasta special of homemade fettuccine with sausage and wild mushrooms.  The pork loin was flavorful and properly cooked, but I think the poor guy had dinner envy because my pasta was out of this world fantastic!  The sausage, mushrooms, and sauce were all divine, but the noodles themselves would have been exquisite just with butter and parmesan.  I think taking advantage of all of the homemade pastas is the way to best enjoy Giorgio.  The portions were generous and we were sure we could not handle dessert . . . until we saw the creme brulee delivered to the table next to us.  Let\\'s just say I am glad we made room for it.;;The only real downside was that the restaurant was loud.  I wouldn\\'t usually dock a star for this, but it was skull-rattling, could-not-hear-the-waitress, could-not-have-a-conversation loud.  We had the misfortune of being seated in the upper room with two very large and very drunk bachelorette parties, so I am hoping it is usually a little better.  I am glad they were having a nice time, but when one group broke out a strobe light and started blowing their penis whistle party favors, a little polite intervention from the staff might have improved the night for other diners.  Oh well - if it is just regular \"Saturday night loud\" on our next trip, a star will be immediately added back.  Mangia Bene!', 'user_id': 'V9n2Qyr-dvNg00BwMWqquQ'}\n",

When we decided to sit outdoors, the server filled our water glasses from a half-empty pitcher that's been resting on the neighboring table, that may or may not have been collecting springtime pollen plainly visible on the superficial layer of the ice cubes. Our server, well very polite, was unable to understand our request, seemed to not know the dishes himself, and told us that because we were using the groupon, we weren't able to use it in conjunction with the small $25 deal for two signature rolls + miso/salad. When we finally ordered the food, I had asked for a description of the sashimi, and he realized that he gave me the wrong order and had to take it back. Of course, he was unable to identify the fish and never really came back.;;As for the food, nothing truly stood out aside from the arch roll with its soy organic warp provided a unique texture. The soft shell crab was quite...underwhelming given its size and oily carb-heavy shell. The bleu boat special, which included moderate amount of sashimi was also disappointing as the fish consisted of that thawed-out of freezer taste and lacked any flavors that are sought after in well-respected sushi joints. By the time our check arrived, our mood was not sweetened despite the free cinnamon ice cream.;;My recommendation, as a patron and lover of sushi, is to really consider training your staff to be fully knowledgeable of your menu items.

It was very well-made - flavorful and not chewy. I believe there were 3 medium-sized tentacles. The lamb meatballs, littleneck clams, and burrata were also good, though I felt the burrata was a bit too watery, and in order to go well with it, I felt the bread that came with the dish should be a bit more glutinous. ;;For our entrees, we tried the diver scallops and hanger steak. Both were outstanding. The scallops were seared to perfection (great texture and flavor), while the steak was very tender and came with a very good sauce. The pricing is not bad, but I do think the portions are a bit on the smaller side for the price. The scallop dish had 3 pieces, which came with parsnip puree and light garnish, while the steak was cut into 4-5 strips and came with a few shiitake mushrooms. We ordered a side of grilled cauliflower, which was also light. ;;For dessert, I highly recommend the chocolate cake. It's so moist, not too sweet (which I really like), and comes with layers of delicious chocolate mousse (or some type of cream with similar texture). Priced at $12 a slice, it's a bit steep, but considering how phenomenal it is, I do think it's worth getting. Drink-wise, they have a pretty extensive list. I tried two cocktails and felt they were too sweet, so maybe next time I'll stick with wine or beer with my meal.\", 'user_id': 'vCUeFAY774VtmpszX9hyGA'}\n",

I think this has been my favorite Garces restaurant so far (haven't been to Tinto yet, so I can't really include that one). Trading Co was beyond delicious!;;The place looks fabulous. It is located on 11th and Locust, an absolute charming part of Philly, especially during this time of the year (spring). They have tables inside, ranging from small ones (seating 2 people) to larger tables that can seat a large party or several parties together. They also have seating outside that looked absolutely fabulous! We sat inside because it was a little too warm!;;When you walk into Garces Trading Co, you can either sit down at a table or walk around and look at the cheeses and meats, the desserts and the wines. We decided to buy a bottle of wine to have during our  meal and we were immediately helped by this amazingly knowledgeable woman. Her recommendation was spot on, and best of all, the wine was not expensive and very tasty.;;Our waiter was very attentive. Not once did our water glasses or wine glasses go empty. He took his time to recommend and explain things on the menu, and he even made a little bit of conversation. ;;We had the chef's selection of three cheeses with condiments. Don't exactly remember what the cheeses were but one was soft, the other semisoft, and the last one hard. The condiments went perfectly well with each cheese (amazing how they know how to pair them). My favorite was the cherry fig marmalade, but the lavender honey and the fennel apricot mostardo were great as well. ;;Next we had the chef's selection of charcuterie. This was great as well. Everything went great with the wine.;;My boyfriend had the Colorado lamb chops served with heirloom potato salad and an amazing glaze. Wow, I will never stop loving lamb. I had the funghi pizza, which was incredibly rich and flavorful. Simply delicious. (Look at the pictures I posted);;Finally we ordered dessert and coffee, both excellent. We ordered a small coffee press that wasn't really that small. In fact, the bf had two cups of coffee, I (who normally don't drink coffee) had one cup, and there was still enough in the fancy little pot to fill another cup and a half. The raspberry marjolaine went great with the coffee and was light enough to finish off an already amazing meal.;;I think that what I liked best about Garces Trading Co was that you could either come in for a full meal, or just have a bottle of wine and some appetizers and still have a great time.\", 'user_id': 'qRyS6tdHA9_3BC9jLZFtwA'}\n",

The new Valanni (or \"Valanni Social\", as the new signs indicate) is more of an upscale gay club/tapas bar. While there are still tables for dinner and such, the main draw now seems to be to the plush front room that faces Spruce Street, with white couches and a fancy changing-light wall. It also appears that there\\'s a DJ there full-time pumping dance remixes into the restaurant. ;;You won\\'t find Valanni on any list of gay bars in Philadelphia but it\\'s definitely become that -- moreso a place where you and friends can go for some moderately-priced cocktails before hitting up bars like Woody\\'s or Tavern on Camac.

The food was delicious!  ;;The bar area was very vibrant and was packed. We decided to have a few drinks in before dinner and their specialty drink menu had a lot of interesting options. The print on the drink menu is really small though and it\\'s pretty dark in there so I could barely read the ingredients. I\\'m in my early 30\\'s and no where near the point where I have a hard time reading small print.  Its just hard to get a good light on the menu to read it. You can read the names of the drinks but the ingredients are tiny.  I get sick every time I drink vodka and asked the bartender if he could make one of their signature drinks with rum instead.  He said that it would taste funny if he did that but he would whip me something special instead.  Whatever it was, it was really good!    ;;We were seated at a tiny round table for two on the lounge side. It was cozy and nice, but the table was about as big as an Altoid. I was surprised they had such small tables for a tapas restaurant.  We ordered a few different dishes and asked the waiter to space them out so that we would have room for them on the table and he was very accommodating about how much food to order and what order to serve it in.  We ordered the Medi-Latin plate, which is served on a long skinny platter that hung off both sides of the table.  Everything on the platter was delicious - far better than I would have imagined. ;;We also got the lobster and crab mac and cheese and it had an entire lobster claw in it plus tons of crab meat.  The sauce was pretty typical for mac and cheese - nothing amazing, but the amount of lobster and crab made up for it. ;;The flatbread was a good but a little lame compared to the rest of the food- I wish we had skipped that and ordered something else instead. It was tasty, just difficult to eat since the toppings didn\\'t stay on the bread. ;;We split the oreo dessert and the hazelnut mouse truffle.  Both were scrumptious.;;Pricing is not available on their website but it was very reasonable.  I believe the Medi-Latin plate was $25 and it included 7 different items (mostly 2 of each item, except calamari and feta which had more).  With a few drinks, the Medi Plate, Mac and Cheese, Flatbread, Polenta, and two desserts, our bill came to about $110.  We had closed out our bar tab before being seated and I believe that was about $30 for two mixed drinks and a beer. ;;Can\\'t wait to go back!', 'user_id': '7EofXzEX_LJSwDmHvtQ4bQ'}\n",

Long story; short; I liked the food enough that I would return during a regular week.  Although I wasn\\'t particularly fond of the grilled romaine salad (the chipotle caesar dressing was a bit too rich and more than a bit too bland); I was infatuated with the crisp polenta croutons.  The red mussels were an instant hit at the table--they could simply serve the savory tomato garlic broth as a lone dish.  My friend gave her hard-earned approval to the Kobe beef burger (\"A-grade\"); which is a big deal in our social circle because she is a burger connoisseur and has been very disappointed lately with the Philadelphia burger scene.  I myself ordered the seafood paella; which was not as authentic as I had preferred (served on a white plate; no burnt rice?; an overwhelming tomato base); but I still scarfed it down.  Even though it wasn\\'t true paella (more of a seafood and tomato risotto); it was generously prepared with plenty of seafood (mussels; shrimp; scallops!; clams; even a sad baby octopus) and seasoned rice.

It is a bright and airy inside although it was a little chilly near the front window (it seemed like the air conditioning was on even though it was dreary and cold outside- the vent was blowing cold air on us).  The host was very slow to bus the tables and reset them which lost a few minutes during our wait.  We had to wait about 20 minutes but it seems like tables turn over quickly.  It was a little awkward to stand along the side of the restaurant while waiting though and I felt like I was watching people eat.  ;;We ordered one brunch sandwich- pastrami, egg, hash browns, peppers on a poppyseed brioche, and one lunch sandwich- duck meatball sandwich.  ;;The brunch sandwich was excellent- the egg was perfectly fried and the saltiness of the pastrami was satisfying for brunch.  It was really fun to have a hash brown patty on the sandwich and have the potatoes along with everything else.  I did sort of wish there was some cheese or something on the sandwich and the portion of pastrami was a little meager.;;The duck meatball sandwich was really outstanding.  The meatballs were so moist and tender and the duck was a fun twist on the classic.  The bread was super fresh and the cheese was perfectly melted.  The raw onions on top added a fresh tart flavor that I really liked.  There is also a rich smear of liver along the inside of the bread.  ;;The prices are reasonable for the quality of the dishes and the service was very attentive.  There were two jars on the table with pepper spreads which were pretty spicy but fun to try.

I came along with a group of 15 people including some kids. It was a Saturday night around 8pm. At first sight it was a beautifially designed restaurant with neon lights to attract attention to customers with lounge area like sitting through upper level and regular restaurant seating on the lower level. Steady night it seemed with plenty of seating availability.  As we were being settled in at first glance;  the menu was done very well with lots of pictures to embrace the food selections. Everything was going well until 5 minutes in service before we could order anything;  the manager of some sort dropped a bomb shell on us that just left us with a very sour note. He came in asking if we're expecting any more people?  We answered no. Also mind u; they dont accept reservations.  On that note; he asked us if we can combine two tables with our group? Now mind u; the tables fit 2 -3 people per table. To have enough space for maneuverability.  So it would be 6-7 people he wanted together at one table. The reason behind the confusion;  he said he is expecting a bigger party which hasn't arrived yet!  Wtf?? So on first thought we said wtf? Our business isnt good enough for our group that we have to accommodate for others that hasn't arrived?  Again there were plenty of seating available. So we all discussed how rude and inconsiderate thst was that it was very disappointing that to have brought to our attention. So we decided to leave overall and take our business elsewhere which wanted our business down the street at tofu house which was a lot busier but also still accepted us no problem besides the wait time of 10 minutes.

Based on the food, atmosphere, and price I would rate it a solid 4 out of 5 stars.;;However, we had the absolute best service and server, Seth, specifically and he alone made this review go from a four to a five. He was kind, gracious, accommodating for picky eaters, polite, and above all HILARIOUS (but not overbearingly / annoyingly so). We felt like we had this professional server with a dose of stand up comedy during dinner. He also stepped in as an amateur photographer and took about 20 group photos for us and kept cracking jokes and keeping us happy. Truly, some of the best service I've ever received and I highly recommend this place for your next big group event near city center\", 'user_id': 'vmXH4Omz-WyOZfSQsboI7Q'}\n",

My thoughts:;;Decor/ambiance: like all other Starr restaurants, the decor and atmosphere was nice. The tables were well-spaced and the pillows in the chairs made for a very comfortable and relaxing dining experience.;;Service: The waiter didn't introduce himself by name so when my future father-in-law asked, he was a little caught off guard and came back a little snarky as if it was a weird question to ask... but the waiter was nice and attentive throughout the night. Food came out quickly. Water wasn't always full but I never had to ask for it.;;Food: Here's why I'm giving the restaurant just 3 stars. I thought the popovers and salted butter were amazing to start. I also enjoyed the apps. I got the lobster bisque which was velvety and delicious. Fiancee got the tuna tartare which was also pretty good. The entrees, however, were the biggest downfall. I got the miso cod (I don't enjoy steak) and everything was just overly salty that it was almost unpalatable. Most of his family got steaks which they seemed to enjoy, however, my fiancee and his dad got the same cut of meat and ordered it medium rare. One came out a little too rare and one came out more on the medium-ish side. For an expensive steakhouse, they should be more consistent.;;Overall experience was good but I'm not really itching to go back anytime soon....\", 'user_id': 'L6AoUoQYFl7mtVWzWcvddQ'}\n",

I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.;;The service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized. I prefer the hole in the wall places where I am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more.\", 'user_id': 'GxpxKYgmVn6kJOx9unoTKQ'}\n",

I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn\\'t they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don\\'t want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! ;;Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.

On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.;;- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?;;- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.;;- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.;;- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.;;EDIT:;;- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.;;- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.\", 'user_id': 'qZwehAvS51R1AQygzR_9IA'}\n",

They contained some little-known pieces by artists like Picasso and Monet as well as a very large collection by Marcel Duchamp, which you just don't see everywhere (or, in my case, anywhere outside of art history books). The second floor's Asian Art wing was also really impressive, with fully rebuilt large-scale rooms displaying a Japanese teahouse, an Indian temple hall, and a Chinese reception hall and scholar's study. These rooms were all completely authentic and unique to any art museum I have ever been to, which give it a more field museum vibe and created a sort of living art experience.

The entire ambiance is quite rustic, with cute wooden drawers decorating the walls, larger-than-life murals and waiters walking around in traditional German garments. The food, as least when you order items like the shanks, are well portioned, especially when considering the $35pp. I also loved the beer, especially the flights of beer (ranging from $10-18), as it allows a non-beer drinker to enjoy an impressive array of various flavors and textures of the classic German beers without feeling overwhelmed.;;For the food, I wasn't a big fan of the cheese and beer soup, as they were served luke-warm to cool and the taste just didn't settle in right with my stomach. However, the braised beef stew with carrots and potatoes were perfect for a wintry evening. For the second course, we got the potato pancakes and the red cabbage salad with bacon dressing. I have to be honest, even though the cabbage may have looked incredibly plain, the subtle bacon aroma, especially when bathed with the acidity of the vinaigrette gave the dish a better representation based on its mouthfeel than its visual features. The potato pancake was unfortunately floppy, in both taste, texture and temperature. As for the main dish, I got the pork shank and my wife got the sausages. The shank was definitely neanderthal sized with thick and flavorful chichurons, although the meat was not flavored at all, possibly due to its size. The sausages were alright, but I wasn't too crazy as they were just slightly too greasy. The desserts, unfortunately fell through. Even though we were offered the apple strudels as options, we were told 10 minutes after ordering that they were out. As a result, we opted for the pretzel pudding and the chocolate cake. Both were incredibly sweet and surprisingly very tough in texture (almost like treebark jerky) and we had to dissect the dish just to avoid chipping our teeth.;;So, with all this, why the 2 stars? Well, it comes down to service. Our waiter, without going in details just did not do the job right. He was never attentive, hard to pin down, looked at us weirdly during the entire dinner, delivered food for 3 out of 4 patrons at a time with an awkward 5 minute pause without any explanation or apologizes.

We let her know we'd be ordering a little at a time because we wanted taste; then decide on our next dish. She was a little put off by that and told us they were busy and we should order all at once.

When I saw that the average rating was only four stars, I was expecting a good but not great meal. Luckily, I can say I truly did get a great meal. ;;To start they have a small but well curated selection of local craft beer, so I indulged in a brew from Free Will brewing, which I rarely see on tap. The restaurant was also taking part in Negroni Week when I went, so I snagged some sips of my fiance's drink. It was stiff and very well made made. Honestly based on the ambiance I would say you could come here just for a drink, but you should definitely stay for the food. ;;For a starter I had one of their meatballs (Sal's old school meatballs that is), and it was quite tasty. The texture was interesting and the flavors cohesive. When it came to picking a main course I was a bit stumped, since everything sounded good, but their special sounded like a good choice. It was a beef cheek ragu, and let me tell you, it was amazing. The beef cheek was cooked to perfection and nearly melted in my mouth. There were cherries in the ragu which added a lovely tart note to the whole dish, and gave it a somewhat less heavy flavor. I wish it were not a special because I might order it every time! In addition I also got to sample some cacio e pepe, which was equally flavorful despite it's simple ingredients. All the pasta was nicely cooked, a true treat and something you can't always take for granted at Italian restaurants. ;;This is the point where I talk about what was possibly the best part of the meal; desserts. I ordered the tartufo al bacio and was not disappointed. It was extremely rich but very enjoyable. While the overwhelming flavor of the dish was chocolate the cherries and hazelnuts were what turned this into a phenomenal dish. The taste was perfect, the texture was perfect and the fact that I wanted more was a good sign. Another one of my dining partners raved about his dish, the olive oil cake, and I snagged a taste of it. Let me tell you, this olive oil cake is unique and delicious. The cake itself has a nice chew to it, and the sauces and cream combine nicely to make one perfect bite. It's not too sweet, so those who don't like desserts might actually really like this dish.;;Overall I was impressed with my trip to Amis. There was nothing to be left desired and I enjoyed every bit of food placed in front of me. With my closing thoughts I will say that the uniforms the servers wear are a bit odd; their car mechanic shirts are more reminiscent of a gas station than an upscale restaurant. I would implore management to reconsider this choice. Then again, it is just a uniform, and neither the service nor food suffered because of it.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the crowd here.  It's always diverse and friendly.  I can come here by myself and strike up convos with the bartenders or with random strangers at the bar.;;Tons of bartenders working on any given day and they serve up the full menu at the bar.  Chris is one of my faves since we share a love of IPA's but they all share a love of beer and of this place as well.;**You'll have to keep in mind the time and which day you go since they serve their brunch menu and Sat and Sundays from 11-3pm.  From 3pm-4pm on these days, they only serve pizza and salads and then the kitchen opens up for the dinner menu after that.**;;FOOD Recommendations:; - Mezze Plate is an excellent starter.  As a fall/winter seasonal item they switched the original hummus to a Pumpkin hummus. Tasting this at first was a surprise and  might not be for everyone but I truly enjoyed it.; - The Abigail and Pancho mussels are solid.  Huge plate full of mussels and the broth/sauce for either one is really flavorful.  The toasted bread that accompanies this dish is perfect to sop up the sauce.  (You may need to ask for more of this bread lol!); - Classic Margherita and Tartufo Pizzas are money as well.  That brick oven heat makes the crust with just the right crispiness and the toppings for either are never skimped.  ; - Brunch Menu Item: Pulled Pork Hash, was alright but too heavy for me.  The man friend ate it up but still commented that it was only mediocre.;;And the main reason why I'm always found here is because this is a full fledged CRAFT BEER spot!;They have all kinds of events where they feature certain breweries or certain types of beers such as a dark beer event, so their tap menu constantly changes.  ;You must come in and see their selection for yourself.  It does not disappoint.;;Firepits and a large outside patio area make chillen outside accessible all year round.;;Take the elevator up to the UT floor and stay for some phenomenal beer, great ambiance and an inviting vibe of chill peeps.\", 'user_id': 'C3yVWxlgdTdh0_1xfd5HVA'}\n",

However, they were super friendly and gave good service. The worst part about this time was the food. I got the \"suckling pig\" special on fridays and my girlfriend got the grilled chicken salad. the \"suckling pig\" is NOT suckling pig. It is BBQ pulled pork. MAJOR DIFFERENCE. and I\\'m pretty sure the suckatash that came with it was frozen or pre packaged, because it didnt taste fresh at all.

Having read reviews of Audrey Claire on Yelp.com I decided to finally make my way to the restaurant. Living 5 minutes outside of center city I have to drive to the restaurant which ended up being very inconvenient. I drove around for 20 minutes trying to find parking. If you live in center city it is ideal to take a taxi to the restaurant. ;;The area is by Rittenhouse Square and is very lively. There are a ton of restaurants within that block. Our party of three ended up getting to the restaurant at 10:40. The dreaded late night customer! The server who handled us couldn\\'t have been more gracious. She sat us and did not rush our table nor give us any attitude while we ate.;;The interior is very simplistic. The walls are painted with very light tones with fantastic lighting throughout. The kitchen is open for all to see which always makes for a pleasant dining experience. The aromas of the kitchen open and extend throughout the restaurant.;;The crowd seems to be 20-30s crowd all well dressed and attractive. There is enough space in the restaurant that sounds do not seem to echo so you can have a nice conversation without having to scream to hear the persons at your table.;;The servers dress was very casual. Our server was wearing some cut up jeans and a sleeveless undershirt. She was fairly knowledgeable with the menu with the questions we had.;;We were a bit rushed with ordering and the presentations of our appetizers and entrees but as is to be expected since we go to the restaurant 20 minutes before the kitchen was closing. I normally like to have a 5-10 minute breathing period between appetizers and entrees. It allows the customer to talk about what they just ate and to digest their food in anticipation for the entree. There was no wait period as soon as we finished our appetizers the entrees were presented. Some people may like this but I do not.;;Before appetizers are brought out we were given a basket of warm pita bread with oil for dipping. I always prefer oil to butter. It is healthier and tastier in my opinion. The oil was VERY mild and had almost no flavor. Perhaps some spices could improve the dipping sauce.;;For appetizers as a table we ordered the grilled flat bread spicy hummus, smoked salmon and mesclun w/ tahina vinaigrette. A lot of times anything that includes smoked salmon has trouble competing with the overpowering flavor and taste of the salmon. Not the case here the hummus blended perfectly and the mesclun and vinaigrette was very mild and was a nice touch.;;We also ordered the Mediterranean spreads. You have a choice of seven spreads. We chose the spicy hummus, sun dried tomato & garlic and the baba ghanoush. All were good but nothing amazing and not in the same ballpark as some Mediterranean restaurants ive been to when comparing the two. It also came with pita bread. I recommend the sun dried tomato of the three.;;For entree I ordered the potato crushed ahi tuna topped with crispy beet shavings. The potato was very mild but the tuna was cooked perfectly. I had mine medium rare. It was not the BEST I ever had, but it was damn close. Perfectly done.;;We skipped on the dessert as it was almost midnight and the servers were beginning to clean up. We were not rushed nor did we receive any of the dreaded \"hurry up\" stares from any of the servers. We enjoyed our wine without any rush and ended up leaving at about 12:15.;;Overall I would give the restaurant a 3.5. I think the hype the restaurant received was a bit of a letdown, but given the time we entered the restaurant could have played a part in the delivery of services. I don\\'t see myself going there again for dinner for awhile, but find it to be ideal to go to for lunch or a sunday brunch. Especially in the spring and summer when it is warm out with their outdoor seating.;;If you want a great meal with no frills attached I suggest Audrey Claire. The attention is solely on the food and this is why the restaurant works!', 'user_id': 'Nw5fp4Y3kYWIn3-7nkF_HA'}\n",

I had seen a write up about it and the healthy/vegan options sounded appealing.  ;;We were sat and I looked at the table (very close to us) and saw the shrimp and grits and immediately got a little worried.  It looked absolutely horrible. Our server was very friendly, and we ordered a juice and a chai latte.  I have to say this was one of the absolute best chai\\'s I\\'ve had.  If only the food measured up.  ;;I asked the server what was the most popular dish.  She RAVED about the grain bowl which sounded healthy and delicious.  She actually said people \"lick the plate.\"  I am so confused at what they were eating.  It came out and the \"grains\" were simply dried rice with some beans thrown on a tostado (soggy) with some greens on top and a cream sauce.  The presentation was terrible (as per my photo) and the food was super bland and not at all fresh.  ;;We also tried the soup of the day which was described as a \"spicy african stew.\"  It came out in this odd HUGE soup bow that was filled with the tiniest amount of soup.  It was barely luke warm, but I don\\'t send things back so we kept it.  The waitress must have not had stew before, because this was simply vegetable soup.  We both tried it and said the same thing \"needs salt\" which is kind of 101 in the culinary world.  It was watery and was spicy like she described but completely lack luster.  Probably the first time I ever left soup in the bowl.   ;;Lastly, we tried to vegan sides.  The scrapple and the bacon mushrooms.  The bacon mushrooms tasted like sugar mushroom and were completely soggy.  If you\\'re looking for the BEST vegan bacon go a little farther to memphis taproom.  The \"bacon\" here is just sad.  The scrapple was not bad.  It was mushroom and some lentils but again could really use some seasoning.  ;;This place would really benefit from having the chefs learn how to properly season and use some herbs.  I felt like I ate air.  I wouldn\\'t ever eat here again but I\\'d definitely go to the cafe in front as I loved the chai and they have lots of cold pressed juices and kombucha.

A great job was done on the decor and layout. Lots of buzz in every direction about this place and for good reason - I can see this becoming a regular warm weather hangout over the next few months for myself and many friends. As a seasoned patron of many of our great city\\'s drinking and dining establishments, a rule to live by is to avoid avoid avoid anywhere until they\\'ve been open for at least a few weeks to give them time to iron out the kinks. Even the best establishments need training wheels at first, and that\\'s OK. We expect it. ;;We made the mistake of thinking it might be low-key and not-so-crowded on Memorial Day Monday after a full-on \\'grand opening\\' weekend. I wouldn\\'t say it was packed, but it was very crowded when we arrived. We had hoped to saddle up to the bar and enjoy a drink and maybe some food, but sadly my fiance and I were only able to find one stool and sorta share it while we had a few drinks and scoped out a table. The beer list is extensive and varied, and I love that they have a decent amount of canned (cheaper) beers. The 3-4 members of the bar staff we dealt with were slammed, yet were all pleasant, seemed experienced and were on point. No complaints there. I just wished we\\'d stayed at the bar. ;;After a while our bellies were rumbling and we had given up on hopes of eating at the bar and pounced on a high top table near the stage/DJ (who needs a lesson on volume control/EQ\\'ing, but that\\'s another story!). As mentioned, we know and expect any establishment will have hiccups on opening weekend. Table service, however, was sorely lacking. The table we grabbed hadn\\'t been cleared and we waited for a good 15 minutes before a busboy or server even glanced in our direction (there was no hostess - the bartender directed us to sit at any table that was open). ;;Eventually a busboy swooped by and grabbed the empty cans and trash left from the previous customers. Not once did anyone wipe down our table or provide clean napkins/silverware. Eventually a waitress stopped and asked if we \"were OK\" (as if she/someone already greeted us and taken an order). We explained we wanted to order food and drinks - my fiance and I each ordered canned beer assuming it wouldn\\'t be a long wait. It was then we were informed half of the beers on our menus were no longer available because, in the servers words \"the management did not plan this out very well\". For food, I ordered the popcorn shrimp, and a burger and fries and my fiance asked for the chopped salad w/ buttermilk dressing. We were never offered water. No biggie, but the high in Philadelphia yesterday was 90 degrees. Also, table still never wiped down, no silverware/napkins.;;After a healthy 20-25 minute wait, our food arrived. But not our canned beers. My burger was tiny but tasty and the fries reminded me of Mickey Dee\\'s, which isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing. The popcorn shrimp was also average - not bad, not great. The salad my fiance received was not only NOT chopped (ripped, maybe?) but was completely missing dressing. Also, still no silverware. Was she expected to eat this thing with her hands? At this point our server was nowhere to be found. Neither were our canned beers we had now ordered a half hour ago. Hmmmmmmm. ;;Finally our flustered server resurfaced with the silverware, when we inquired about our canned beers she took on the look of a deer in headlights, and rushed away after promising that the beers were on the house. Another 10 minutes pass (you can\\'t make this stuff up), the beers arrive with a second promise from our waitress that they are on the house. We thank her, she walks away, and... what a surprise! One of the beers is wrong! *Facepalm* ;;At this point, we\\'re simply trying to quickly finish up our food (the salad was average according to my other half) and either get out while we\\'re still relatively calm, or settle our tab and head back to the now less crowded bar. We ask for our check, and comically, she has it to us instantly. And what happens to be on the check!?!? The beers that she promised were on the house (on multiple occasions!!!I) Ugh. I couldn\\'t help but laugh. ;;At this point it was either leave a shitty tip, make a scene with the waitress, or ask for the manager. The easiest and most gratifying thing to do was to take a deep breath, and... leave a shitty tip. So that\\'s what we did. And, as someone who has worked in the service industry and has many friends and family who have and still do - I feel appropriately guilty about leaving such a shitty tip - but that\\'s the trade off for such shitty, shitty, service. ;;In closing, this place has TONS of potential and will probably do very well. As I\\'ve mentioned above we expected to have less than perfect service, and they\\'ll no doubt iron out these kinks in time. We can only hope they quickly filter out the inexperienced/clueless employees & focus on a better overall customer experience.', 'user_id': 'FwRIArLW3gPwCBoz4xPm5g'}\n",

I've been just about everywhere, and while there are other places that might be better for special occasions, in terms of food quality, price, and atmosphere, Mercato can't be beat for a regular dining spot.;;The restaurant itself is cozy and romantic.  The floors are hardwood, with exposed brick on the walls.  The kitchen is open and right in the back of the dining area.  The space is really tiny, and the tables are very close together, which may seem uncomfortable at first, but it really creates a lovely atmosphere.  In the warmer months, there are outdoor tables that you can sit at as well.  It's a BYOB, so you save some money by bringing your own bottle (or two!). ;;The service here is flawless, and the host or hostess will send a text when your table is ready, so you can grab a drink at one of the other bars nearby, or take a stroll through the beautiful, quiet surrounding neighborhoods.  A few things you should know beforehand: (1) Mercato doesn't take reservations, so there is often a wait.  Sometimes it can be pretty long if you are trying to get a table at prime dinner time.  (2) The place is tiny.  There is barely any room.  When it is full, it gets really loud.  There will also not be much space between you and other parties.  If you have a big party, it can take a really long time to get a table because you will need to wait for several parties to get up before they can join the tables. (3) It's cash only, and not exactly cheap, so fill up your wallet beforehand.  If you do forget to bring cash, there is a convenience store a short walk away that has an ATM you can use.  ;;The food is where Mercato excels.  I highly recommend the meatballs for an appetizer.  There are really flavorful, and the sauce is one of the best I've had on anything.  The meat and cheese trays are also really delicious, and everything is high-quality.  I brought my father here once, and both of us tried salads and were delicious.  ;;For an entree, I always get the bolognese.  Every time I come here, I say I'm going to get something different, but then I see it and I end up ordering the same thing.  I can't say enough good things about the bolognese.  The dish combines pasta with chunks of veal and pork in a cheesy, cream sauce.  The meat is extremely (and I mean EXTREMELY) flavorful, and the noodles are perfect to hold the sauce.  ;At first the portion looks a bit small, but it's really more than enough.  They have a side that combines broccoli rabe with sausage and meatballs and is also one of my favorites. ;;Finally, the service is where Mercato really shines and has won me over for life.  Earlier this winter, we decided to go on a cold evening.  We got there and were told it would be a twenty minute wait.  We waited outside under the heat lamps for almost an hour.  At first, we were frustrated about being told such an incorrect estimate, but when we were finally seated, they apologized profusely, and brought out a free meat and cheese tray with other goodies.  When our meatballs were brought out a bit too rare, they cooked the originals more and brought us out an additional order as well.

You are seated at a table, and a waiter comes over to see if you want any drinks to start (the drink menu is on an iPad). Then he/she directs you to the salad bar to start. Then you flip over a car on your table indicating that you want meat and waiters come by your table every few minutes with long skewers of meat to ask you if you would like some and if you would like a piece that is more on the rare side or more on the well side. Below is some more detail on the salad bar, meat selection, atmosphere, and price. ;;SALAD BAR: ;The salad bar was surprisingly expansive. They have everything from arugula salad, to salami and cheeses. They also had some fresh asparagus and beets, rice, and an assortment of cheeses. Everything was good but I would suggest not filling up on this stuff because the meat is where you get your real value. ;;MEAT: ;The meat here is really the best part of the meal. The waiters walk around with different cuts of different meats and you can tell them if you would like some or not. There is a picture and description of each meat at your table so that you know what you're ordering. I thought the leg of lamb and the top sirloin were the two best. Everything is really nicely cooked and you leave the place pretty filled up. ;;ATMOSPHERE: ;The scene here was probably not what you would expect from a Brazilian steakhouse. It is located in a very business-centric area and there was a pretty big crowd at the bar for happy hour (You can hear the music from the dining room). Everything about this place is modern and the tables are spread out so that you don't really hear your neighbors. But for me, it lacked any sort of charm. Not really a foodies' ideal place (even though I wouldn't say I'm a foodie myself. ;;PRICE: ;This is the biggest problem with Chima and I why I couldn't give it anything more than 3 stars. Dinner costs $54 each! I don't care how much you think you can eat, you'll never make up that cost.  I came here with a gift certificate for one dinner and paid for my partners' food. If I didnt have the gift card, it would have never been worth it. If you dont have any gift certificates you are looking at a bill of over $70 each after tax and tip (not including drinks).

I really do. But I can\\'t sweep my last experiences under the rug, and chalk it up to \"bad day\". Last week, my husband and I drove by and he asked if I wanted to go in for dinner, and for the first time ever,  I said no.;;One busy Saturday afternoon, my husband and I were absolutely starving, and all that could satisfy my hunger was a burger. Off to MT we went! We walked in and were pushed out of the dining room back into the bar by a surly man who told us to wait for a table. Ok, no problem, we can handle that, we just weren\\'t sure where to go, since no one made an attempt to help us with a table, and we know you can\\'t seat yourself. We have been here before, we know the drill. So we waited, and then were sat, and our waitress comes over about 10 minutes later, we knew everything we wanted: 2 beers, fried greenbeans app (we were curious about this one, since we haven\\'t tried it before), a burger for me (ordered medium rare), and my husband got the port richmond platter. Our greenbeans never arrived, but our meals did. I was really disappointed that she forgot the beans, I really wanted to try them. But I brushed it off and moved on. We actually didn\\'t bother to mention it to her, we didn\\'t want her to feel bad. We decided to wait for the bill, and if it was on there, we would just ask her to take it off. Anyways, since I cannot stand a well done burger, I always check before taking a bite to make sure it is cooked properly. I cut into the burger and it was so well done that the meat was crumbling out of the bun. I called the waitress over and showed it to her and asked for another one. She agreed that it was well done, and said she would bring me a new one. 20 minutes later, my husband is finished his meal, our beers have been empty and at the edge of the table in hopes to be re-filled, and I still have no burger. The waitress comes over and asks \"how is everything over here?\" and I just looked back and said \"still waiting\". It took her a second, but she realized and ran back to the kitchen, but didn\\'t return with food for another 5 minutes or so. My burger finally came out, and it was less cooked this time, still not med-rare, but edible as it was. So I decided to eat it. We didn\\'t feel like doing another beer at this point so I asked for a water, and my husband got a soda. Now, when i was a bartender, a general rule of thumb was that when someone had been drinking beers, then ordered a soda, it was on the house. But the soda still ended up on the bill, along with the burger, but the greenbeans were absent. She came back over to pick up the bill and said \"oh, i don\\'t know why i put that soda on there, i will take that off\" (we didn\\'t promt her, she offered that up willingly). But still, shouldn\\'t the burger have come off to? But alas, this had not been the first time my food was cooked improperly at MT, and it will not be the last.;;In addition to this experience, my husband frequents this bar after work and on one occasion he came in and ordered the hanger steak medium. It came out rare. Long story short, he had to send it back twice, and it kept coming back rare. He finally told the bartender to just take that steak back and throw it on the grill, don\\'t cook a new one. But they just couldn\\'t get it right.;;I really hate to see a good place go bad. But I feel like each time i go back, it gets worse. MT really needs to update their menu a little too, not a lot on her thrills me anymore and there are never any changes or specials. Also, why is there never any PBC beers on tap? The brewery is one minute away, why can\\'t they have it on tap? I am looking forward to the hot dog cart this summer, though. Gourmet hot dogs and good beers. I will still frequent MT for this, but dinner in the dining room is going to be out for a little while.', 'user_id': 'I30Q5xP79wRuEWJyfiiarw'}\n",

It is in Kensington but straddles the border with Fishtown. Don't let the fact it is in Kenso keep you away. This side of Kenso never was that bad and if you want proof that the place is on the ascent...just look at the rent/mortgages on Realtor.com for the 19125 zip code.

Of course it has a full bar and a solid wine list. no its not Tria but it is beats out the likes of Monk's. Some of the drafts were: Walt Wit, Original Sin Cider, London's Pride, SN Anniversary Ale(but Southern Hemi was just behind it),Sly Fox Pikeland Pils, Ommegang Rare Vos, Stone Smoked Porter, Green Flash Hop Head Red Ale and Sly Fox Saison.

You can't miss her. She is a ginger and has many tattoos on her arms. Very attentive and knows her beers. She inspected each glass before using them. I mean she was holding them up to the light to ensure they didn't have a speck of hardwater stain! Plus she picked only good music off the bar's iPod. I never had to wait for her to ask me if I wanted another drink. She found time to chat. She even poured me an ounce of the aforementioned Rachbier from the wee bit that was lingering in an opened bottle. I think she knew the other punter rather well so it wasn't like she was just stiffing him on the last ounce.;;The cost was descent. I got thre at 11:00 AM and didn't leave until 2:30.

What other Philly bar do you know that features Polish & Welsh cooking? My beef & onion pasties were great. Nothing frozen here folks. That pastry crust was light and flakey. My Girlfriend's eggs and hash were very good according to her....I have never eaten corned beef hash in my life. The coffee was solid and kept in a carafe as not to render the product ass-like from the heat and oxygen. Hey it was Sudnay at 11 AM and I needed to counter the beer. LOL. Shit even the water must have been filtered because I know Philly tap water's fine aroma all too well. Hey the little things do matter. Oh and the wings were done wel. The oil was peanut and it didn't taste like it was old oil. Plus the scallions were a nice addition as was the real blue cheese that seemed to have an added ingredient (Old bay?)...not sure but it was great. they were not greasy nor were they dripping in a hot sauce. Nice and crisp. Oh and I forgot the wasabi mayo that was under my Pasties was banging!;All I know is that Brendan is busting his ass to make this place awesome!!!

At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.  He said it was out of this world.  A few minutes later we were served some delicious Italian bread and butter.  The bread was wonderful.  We then placed our order after looking over the menu.   We got the escargot as our appetizer.  This was absolutely wonderful!   My husband knew he wanted the Seafood Pescatore.  I decided to have the Veal Marsala and a side of meatballs.  We enjoyed our bread until our meals were brought out.  Now my Veal Marsala was hands down the best dinner out I have EVER had.  The veal was tender; the mushrooms were delicious; and the sauce;  well I think I had dreams about it that night.  My husband\\'s dinner was also wonderful.  He used to prepare this himself and was surprised at how fresh and tender the mussels were .  He said he would get that again.  Now the meatballs are something you HAVE to get if you go to Ralph\\'s!!!  These were nice and firm and the gravy was wonderful!  After all this good food we had to finish off the night with a cannoli.  My husband and I both ordered one and got one to go for my Dad.

If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way); this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi\\'s (NYC) and Grimaldi\\'s (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage; roasted fennel; tomato sauce; mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad\\'s Hat rye; Luxardo cherry; white vermouth).  It says it serves one; but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough; mortadella; ricotta; pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He\\'s lucky I didn\\'t stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair; he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could\\'ve eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\"Cookie Jar\" - pignoli; almond cookies; chocolate biscotti; pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I\\'m in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri\\'s other restaurants; but I\\'m checking them out next time I\\'m in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!', 'user_id': 'mukbs7Bj65O2fIVMi935nA'}\n",

I ended up getting huevos rancheros and potato pancakes, both of which I split with my girlfriend.  The potato pancakes ($9) were really delicious, although you only got three small pancakes.

In both visits, the pastas were huge highlights. Chef Kulp is coming from a Michelin starred Italian restaurant in New York, and it shows. We had the pisatchio agnoletti with rabbit ragu. The filling was pureed pistachios and was bright in flavor and color, topped with a delicate braised rabbit sauce. I dream of that pasta. On my next visit I had the seafood pasta with black and which picchi. The textures and flavors of this dish were so complex, plus it was a work of art to behold. The octopus and veal carpaccio appetizers were also fabulous. ;;The most extraordinary thing, however, that I ate at Fork was the two-person duck special. Literally, they brought out a whole roast duck for us to see. He was golden and crisp looking. Then they took him back to the kitchen and turned him into 5 different amazing duck dishes, including breast, meatballs (the highlight), and procuitto salad. ;;Finally, there are really interesting, not overly sweet, cocktails. ;;Seriously, I can't tell you how much Fork has improved in my estimation since getting its new chef.

He also gave good vegetarian recommendations (shout-out to my fellow herbivores), as well as informing us of what's popular at the restaurant. I ended up ordering the Panang curry with brown rice on a level 3 spice range, with 1 being the mildest and 5 being the spiciest. It was PERFECT. Everything, from the appearance to the spices, was just sublime. I was a bit upset that they took away my dish with a few bites left (I planned on finishing all of it!) when the cake came out. However, everything else was just so nice and I knew I was going to come back, so it didn't affect me toooo much. Since we had a large table, I wasn't sure what everyone else got, but it all looked pretty good. Can't wait to come back here on Friday for their lunch specials!;;A special mention has to go out to the manager/Xiandu queen Nancy. She has got to be one of the coolest, kindest managers I have ever interacted with! She kept the place open well past their closing time to make sure we were well accommodated and not rushed out. This is just one of the many examples of true customer service. So many places simply view their customers as business transactions, but you could tell that this place truly wanted their customers to have a legit dining experience.

This is one. My wife Karin and I are BYOBers. However, for our two anniversary days, one when we met and four days later for our first date, we like to visit top notch restaurants who have a liquor license. We chose to have lunch at Bistro La Minette for our anniversary. What a wonderful treat that was.;Ambiance: it was quiet on a Saturday afternoon. We like the feel of the room, simple, clean, airy. ;Service: our server Lily was wonderful. She was professional, friendly, interesting, knowledgeable. We enjoyed chatting with her. She added much to our experience.;Food: was tasty, well presented, flavorful and, at times, wow moments. We chose the lunch prix- fixe. Karin had the chilled pea soup with creme fraiche and mint. It was like eating in the garden. She chose the trout for her main. It was very good, loved the fingerling potatoes. I chose the escargot, a classic French dish. Delish. For my main, I chose the oeufs du pecheur, a very, very tasty dish. Baguette toast, two poached eggs, mussels in a tarragon cream sauce. The sauce was absolutely divine. For dessert, we had the chocolate pot de creme and the puff pastry with pastry cream and raspberries. Wonderful. The baguette was cooked in house and it reminded us of Paris.;We were treated to a small glass of Banyuls, a Southern French port like dessert wine and a Sauterne. Thanks.;With the check came two chocolate truffles, placed on a large serving dish. The dish was decorated with chocolate wishing us a Happy Anniversary. A wonderful touch and a wonderful finish to a great lunch. We won't forget that experience anytime soon.\", 'user_id': 'TjeeFCU7--LULHMCd4ukXA'}\n",

I'm not gonna lie, this place is tiny, but now that you know it's small, you shouldn't be surprised.  The food was tasty, but not quite seasoned enough for my taste.  To be fair though, it is the week after Thanksgiving, and I've been eating my Mom's cooking for the past week.  Regardless of where you go, no soul food restaurant is gonna match Grandma's or Mom's cooking, but this place is good, and I'll definitely go back.;;* So technically this isn't an ode....so what...shut up! ;-)\", 'user_id': 'OSbuXWZqW4iouNTKibaw6w'}\n",

We had heard a lot of great comments about this place, so we decided to check it out.  Our reservation was at 8:15 and when we arrived we were told that our table was not ready and that we should have a drink at the (extremely overcrowded) bar.  Because they have seating around the entirety of said (extremely overcrowded) bar, it was difficult to find a spot to actually order a drink, but after a few minutes I found an opening.  I ordered the Barcelona Gintonic and got the wife the Guns and RosÃ¨s.  Having had gintonics in Barcelona (the city) I had wrongfully assumed that they were going to serve me a similar style gintonic - a massive red wine glass of ice, gin, some tonic, and the remainder of the bottle of tonic served along side.  Instead it was a Barcelona the restaurant gintonic, which was served in a white wine glass about half full with a sprig of rosemary. Fine, not quite what I was hoping, but still a decent gin and tonic.  The wife\\'s drink was much better.  It was lite and refreshing without being overly sweet.  We ended up having to wait an hour for our table, which i view as inexcusable if you have a reservation.  We ordered the croquettes, bacon wrapped dates, chorizo & figs, and pulpo tapas and the paella mariscos (which the waitress informed us would take 30 minutes).;Croquettes - again, I was expecting something more like the Spanish croquetas you get in Barcelona the city, but these were Barcelona the restaurant\\'s version.  They were balls instead of the slightly more cylindrical shape I was expecting and the balance of the ham and cheese was off (needed more ham). They weren\\'t great, but they were pretty good.;Chorizo and figs- interesting mix.  Again the balance seemed a bit off.  They could have scaled back a little on the figs and balsamic reduction.  Again, pretty good, but not great.;Bacon wrapped dates - it\\'s hard to screw up bacon wrapped dates.  They were good, but I have had better. In Philly.;Pulpo - in Barcelona the city, this means \"octopus\".  In Barcelona the restaurant, this apparently means \"potatoes\".  This dish was a HUGE disappointment.  On the entire plate there were only a few tiny pieces of actual octopus compared to the remaining 95% which was potatoes.  Maybe in Barcelona the restaurant if you actually want octopus, you need to order the patatas bravas.  The table next to us had the same experience and I believe the ended up commenting to the waiter.;Paella- we ended up waiting an hour for the paella, not 30 minutes.  The seafood was plentiful, but it tasted sandy and did not seem particularly fresh.  In Barcelona the city if there are prawns in paella they are cooked to perfection and the shell practically falls off.  At Barcelona the restaurant the prawns are cooked in a clever manner that seems to fuse the shell to the prawn, ensuring that you get your hands good and messy trying to clean them.;My overall summary of Barcelona the restaurant is that if you are looking for a cool looking spot to hang out, socialize, and be seen, it is a great choice and probably the only place in this neighborhood fit for that purpose.  If you are looking for a place where you can get a table for 8 and try a bunch of different dishes, again, this is probably a good option.  If you want really good food, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for something on par with the restaurants in Barcelona the city, Barcelona the restaurant is NOT the place for you.', 'user_id': 'jo2wFomf4uXWdY16REzGUg'}\n",

I first became familiar with the company and their stable of fine restaurants (Eleven, Kaya, Casbah, Soba, Umi, and  yes , Mad Mex)  when I took a job at Eleven while living in Pittsburgh. It was also my first experience with an abusive and plate-throwing chef; Executive Chef Derek Stevens.;;My first Mad Mex experience came about five years ago in the University of Pittsburgh suburb of Oakland. Since then, I\\'ve dined at about half of their ten locations in State College, Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio.  For this review, I\\'m going to focus on Philadelphia\\'s University City location, since that\\'s where the majority of my visits have taken place in the last year.;;Sandwiched between Drexel and UPenn.. Mad Mex clearly targets the college crowd not only with affordable and delicious \"Cali-Mex\" cuisine, but with an atmosphere that differs from your typical chain. There\\'s no looped top 40 crap here.. they place a decent mix of alternative music. They expand beyond the usual Anheuser-Busch and Miller brewing company draft beers, and have an impressive array of craft and specialty brews on tap. They take the food here pretty serious as well, as the expansive eight page menu proves. While ambitious, everything I\\'ve ever had here has been excellent and quite affordable, too. ;;The big draw, though, what brings me back, are their put-you-on-your-ass Margaritas. Once you get past the music, the graffiti on the walls, and the young, boisterous crowd, the next thing to strike you may be their menu. Eight pages of every type of Cali-Mex food you can think of.. and then some. Don\\'t get it twisted and think this place is a stuck up, high end pillar to fine dining. They certainly don\\'t take themselves too seriously.. their lighthearted menu is full of corny little puns and funny names for entrees such as the \"Overtly Masculine Grilled Portabello with Foo-Foo Tofu Fajita\" which quips, \"Don\\'t worry, ordering this won\\'t make you straight\" and even a few risquÃ© jokes if you look hard enough.;;You HAVE to make an effort to make it here for Happy Hour, especially if you like Margaritas..  this is your spot. You have Raspberry, Mango, Peach, Lime, Watermelon, Strawberry, Kiwi, etc. During Happy Hour, you can have a gigantic 22oz \"Big Azz Margarita\" for $7.00 - instead of the usual price of $10.00. Margaritas aside, they have a killer selection of beer and tequila.. don\\'t overlook the tequila tastings! Their selection may be the best in all of University City. For penny-pinching college students.. Mad Mex is hard to beat. Monday through Thursday from 2pm-4pm, there are several half price options for students, not to mention TWO happy hours every day of the week - the first from 4:30-6:30pm and the second is from 10pm-12am. As a little \"insider\" tip.. get the \"Little Butt Margarita\" during Happy Hour and get the \"Big Azz Margarita\" during non-happy hour times. That\\'s the way to get the most bang for your buck, trust me.;;As I said earlier, they have a thoroughly extensive menu and I\\'ve never had a bad dish here. They have five types of salsa and three types of freshly made dips, my favorites being the fire roasted tomato-chipotle and pineapple-habanero (HOT!) which are always served with locally made tortilla chips. A huge assortment of appetizers, soups/chillis, wings, salads, 17 types of burritos, 7 different enchiladas, chimichangas, quesadillas, fajitas, taco platters, and multiple desserts fill the 8 page menu . I\\'ve had the wings, chilli, 4 or 5 different burritos, and my girlfriend loves the fajita platters here as well. I don\\'t think you can make a bad choice if you tried. ;;As much as I love Mad Mex though, the staff can be surly, sometimes a bit rude when it\\'s busy and service tends to be a bit slow (perhaps deliberately to generate more liquor sales..) and the later you go, the more raucous the crowd, but I guess that\\'s par for the course. However, the fact that I can get silly drunk on 3 \"Big Azz Margaritas\" during Happy Hour for a really decent price, and enjoy some pretty good and unique Cal-Mex food is enough to bring me back time and again.. and I live two hours away!;;Mad Mex has food that far exceeds the atmosphere and it\\'s a don\\'t-miss location for Happy Hour for myself and many other University City area locals. If you\\'re in the area, and perhaps even if you\\'re not, definitely check it out. It\\'s inexpensive, inventive, and original. Thank me later.. I\\'ll have a Strawberry-Kiwi Margarita, if you don\\'t mind.', 'user_id': 'j9vLZfOZegJrfcb2LjQclg'}\n",

The fact that this place is so popular (and so packed) is something I find really depressing.  I feel like it\\'s a sad statement on people\\'s tastes--although admittedly most of the people who post good reviews are talking about the drink specials and not the food.  It seems there\\'s more of a consensus that that this is more of a place to drink than eat, and I see complaints of poor service are also common.;;I think the food here is pretty bad, and overpriced relative to the low quality.  I ordered a burrito and the meat seemed low quality, and the burrito itself was enormous but it was mostly stuffed with rice and beans, more rice than beans.  There was a sad excuse for \"pico de gallo\" which was cooked, and mostly tomato, a far fry from the fresh chunky salsa that any legit mexican restaurant would serve.;;I seriously would have appreciated about half as much food, but higher quality ingredients.  The food was far too salty, yet too bland, and while it wasn\\'t super dry, the meat (chicken) and burrito as a whole were a little dry.  I didn\\'t finish my burrito and didn\\'t take it home.  My girlfriend ordered a side of guacamole with her meal--mistake!!!  They charged $1.50 extra for it, and she said it wasn\\'t any good and didn\\'t touch it.  We\\'re both guacamole lovers so in order for this to happen, it has to be pretty freaking bad.;;Service was poor, and it wasn\\'t just the waiter, although I think he could have been more attentive.  Our waiter came out once at the beginning, we ordered drinks (happy hour specials on beer--not bad specials), then returned for us to order our food, and that was pretty much his involvement until he showed up with the check.  There was a miscommunication about the price (and size) of one of the beer specials; our server botched it.  At the end when we got the check, he eventually took it back and got it worked out with a small credit to our check.  So good job for fixing that one.  But other than that...my water ran out and the waiter never came back to refill it...he never came back to check on us and ask how our food was.  Oh, and when we first came in here the restaurant was out of glasses for water (of course, they weren\\'t out of glasses for beer--why didn\\'t they just use beer glasses?), so it was a little while into our meal when they actually came out with water.;;The atmosphere in here is very loud.  There was noise from conversation but also the music was turned way up.  I wasn\\'t really crazy about the music.  The atmosphere was also dark, with a sort of cozy feel, but it didn\\'t really do it for me.  It didn\\'t feel homey.  Some bars feel lively, this one just felt noisy.  I think a difference for me is a lack of community feel...in this bar everyone is segregated off into their own tables and groups, so instead of like having a communal sociable atmosphere it\\'s just a bunch of private groups whose noise is interfering on my space.  So I feel like I\\'m getting the bad aspects of the place being crowded without the benefits of it.  Something about the setup screams \"corporate bar\", like the experience is being carefully manufactured by a business with the sole intention of making money.;;I wouldn\\'t come back here.  It\\'s absolutely not my scene...not the sort of atmosphere I like, not the sort of food I like.  Like I said, I find it depressing how popular this place is...like it just screams that there are hordes and hordes of people out there who have really different taste from me.  I guess that\\'s how life is, but...frankly I\\'d be happy to see this place taken off the map and replaced by something completely different.;;2 stars and not one because they had some decent beers on tap, and because the food was edible and under $10, and I didn\\'t get food poisoning or something...also because the waiter did correct the error.  But a part of me wants to give one star.  Either way, I\\'m never coming back, and I\\'ll be praying that this place goes out of business.', 'user_id': 'tx7RTGrlLKBG9c93lnio5Q'}\n",

Gotta quote Bob Ross, \"We don\\'t have mistakes, just happy little accidents\";  Planned on eating some where else, they were booked. Look at that, a pizzeria, with wine. Not what I planned on, but that sounds (and smells) pretty good. I am not obsessed with pizza like my wife is, but this was some of the best pizza I have ever had. It was just me, my wife, and my daughter, and we ordered 4 pizzas. They all come personal size so that\\'s not too much food if I don\\'t tell you that we also got two apps, and some pasta. Margherita(you know what that is right?), Pepperoni, Mushroom(with ham and garlic crÃ¨me), & San Danielle ( prosciutto and arugula), all delicious. ;  We sat at the bar, not what I usually do but, It\\'s a pizzeria, not really a big difference at the table two feet from me. Service was good. Wine was surprisingly good. This place was a little more casual than I planned on dinning that night, but the cocktails and wines were top notch for sure. I read another review that said it was loud but, It\\'s a pizza joint, not a library. Anyway I wasn\\'t bothered by the noise.;  The guys making the pizza are amazing. I timed them. One guy starts the dough, and by the time its ready to go to your table, only like four minutes later. I told the guy, you shouldn\\'t get paid by the hour, you should ask for $1 a pizza, you\\'ll be rich. But they\\'re not just fast, they have like a dozen pizzas on the menu, and I feel like I have to go back for at least four of them.(Tartufo is at the top of my list) ,Half the menu is white pizza, the other half is red, and the flavor combinations are excellent. Nothing too boring, nothing with an unnecessary overload of conflicting flavors, a few you already know, a few you are surprised to see but you know you have to try it  everything paired nicely. ;  And then gelato, I don\\'t even remember the flavors. Something with salted caramel, something with coffee and chocolate, does it really matter? The drinks were awesome, The food was delicious, and the gelato that was so good I forgot what I even ordered.;  I am defintely going back (I have like eight more pizzas I have to eat), I only wish I\\'d found them sooner so that I could eat outside.', 'user_id': '6bztzoRe1kSfjg6fGRxy7Q'}\n",

It reflects on what you get in return...;;You may find better traditional, Italian style pizza at a restaurant downtown, but in terms of American style pizza joints, this blows everything I\\'ve ever had away. Beddia offers a wide variety of toppings not seen in other corner pizzerias and gives an option of the arrabiata pizza, spicy but delicious. ;;If you don\\'t live close by, probably not an ideal place to get pizza, but an absolute must try for Philadelphians and those visiting.', 'user_id': 'Ibu7ZjV_apr6531-jUthuA'}\n",

I had been to Varga once for drinks a few months ago and, after perusing the dinner menu then, knew I wanted to go back for dinner.  Fast forward a couple of months to this past weekend when some friends from D.C. came up to visit; we wanted a low key dinner before heading out on the town, so I suggested Varga.  ;;The first thing I loved about this place, which I discovered when I was there a few months ago, is the beer selection.  There are multiple selections on tap for any type of beer lover; IPAs, stoudts, wheats, lagers.  Each beer is described to a tee on the beer menu so, say you're like me and love hoppy, piney IPAs but are sometimes disappointed when you order one that tastes like too much alcohol or wheat, you can choose a beer based on the flavors you like.  These guys know their beer and that alone makes it worth stopping by.;;After we moved on to the dinner menu, we settled on the Truffled Mac & Cheese as our appetizer (I would've ordered some more apps, because they all sounded delicious, but we were going out afterward and didn't want to be too full).  What I loved most about this dish was how subtle the truffle and bacon flavors were.  Truffle and bacon can too often overpower the dish they are being used in, but that was not the case here.  The truffle flavor was nicely integrated into the cheese sauce (which was nice and light as well) and the bacon was limited to crispy pieces crumbled all over the top of the dish.  It was a great spin on your traditional mac & cheese.  ;;For dinner, I ordered the Kobe Burger.  I'm not sure if the beef was actual Japanese Kobe or American kobe (I'm guessing the latter since it would've been more expensive otherwise), but, regardless, it was a perfectly cooked (I ordered it medium), melt in your mouth burger.  I did not find the cheese (cheddar I believe) or bacon to be too much.  My one minor complaint about the burger is that the roll was so soft and the burger was so juicy (that is not part of the complaint) that the roll got so mushy, I had to finish the burger with a knife and fork.  Also, I wasn't really a fan of the homemade ketchup; it tasted like a fruit that I couldn't quite place...and it was just too sweet for me.  The friends that I was with loved it though.  ;;I can't really comment on any other entrees; one of my friends also got the burger (and had the same mushy roll problem)... my other friend got the hand made rigatoni, which I didn't taste.  He seemed to like it though.  ;;The other thing I love about Varga is that it is very reasonably priced... between 3 of us we had one appetizer, 3 entrees and 6 drinks (5 cocktails and one beer) and the bill was $100 (not including tip).  When I can walk out of a place with a full stomach and a good buzz for $40, I am happy.  Without drinks, it probably would've been half that.  ;;I would highly recommend Varga to anyone who loves trying different beer and/or enjoys great food with a unique twist.   I am really looking forward to going back so I can try some other things from the menu (like the breakfast cereal ice cream and the ribs).  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I personally can't give any place 5 stars if I've only eaten there once.  If it's as good next time as it was this time, I'll be updating my rating to 5.;;One last thing...we went around 9pm on a Friday night and there was about a half an hour wait.  However, you can also choose to sit at the communal table (a long table which seats about 8 or 10) in the front window if you don't want to wait.  We did that and had the whole table to ourselves for the 1.5 hours that we were there.  So, if you don't feel like waiting to be seated, it's not a bad choice.\", 'user_id': 'lsVW_oscHIuleUM6AAjVTg'}\n",

The walls were also pretty thin, as I could hear the person in the room next door engaging in \"late night activities\".

All the meeting rooms are too small; if you combine them together, you get a very long and narrow room that makes the people in the back feel like they're not even participating.  The ballroom is a pretty decent size, as is the exhibit hall, but the congregation areas on the 4th and 5th floors (outside those rooms) are ridiculously long and the escalators are inconvenient.  The main lobby has lots of great chairs - I even took a nap on one, since I'm staying with friends while attending this conference - but needs more outlets.  The restaurant (13) and bar (Circ) are jaw-droppingly overpriced.  $9.50 for a vodka diet? $6 for a tiny bit of hummus?  Seriously?  And the wifi...I didn't even bother.  $13 PER DAY for non-hotel guests.  I've heard rumors that the parking is $45/day but I've been using public lots and garages instead, there are a million around.  The Starbucks in the lobby is priced normally and has lots of seating.  The official conference center is convenient to get to from inside.  Reading Terminal Market is right across the street for lunch, but you'll have to go elsewhere for dinner because it closes at 6pm.;;I'll be back next year for another conference and I'll be staying in a room that time, so I'll definitely update my review then.\", 'user_id': 'yoMW1daUiNENR6HiM7UxWA'}\n",

I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.;;I was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.;;Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  ;;My eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.\", 'user_id': 'mzXDuhZBPdHfMIk1YXP0mQ'}\n",

But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement.  In the end, I'm glad I did.  This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home.  They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.;;Their specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast.  It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch.  The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely.  It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad.  The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few.  They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes!;;The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food.  One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required.  Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.  But if you can score seats here for brunch, then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning (or recover from last night's activities).  Can't wait to come back and try out the dinner menu.\", 'user_id': 'NqZJMXmwEtirJvx-qpyLmQ'}\n",

I've been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences. Both times I visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu. ;;My first bit of advice is, if you haven't been before and want to know what to order, the answer is the Cyprus Breakfast. This meal, and it is quite filling, has everything you could want for a brunch. Two extra crispy fried eggs, a big slab of ham, two pieces of a fried Mediterranean cheese, some delicious bread and a salad, all together on one glorious plate. My fiancÃ© and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip, I also ordered the lamb sandwich, which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom, drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding. ;;Kanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do, it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that, there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating. I saw the chef (who I believe is also the owner) leave the kitchen, go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table. Honestly, this was really touching to see. ;;I couldn't recommend Kanella more highly. I will be back again soon!\", 'user_id': 'nkBpODDjnP-nD9uz1Z4YsA'}\n",

I therefore cannot speak to their cheese pizzas.  We ordered a red pizza with arugula and pepperoni.  It was very satisfying and we found the crust tasty.  Sauce was excellent and actually tasted better the next day cold coming out of the fridge (who doesn't love cold pizza).  The arugula was fresh and awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something slightly different.  On the otherhand the pepperoni was nothing special and got lost in the mix.;;As others have said this appears to be a hipster haunt but we are far from hipsters and found it quite friendly.  Plenty of other families present.  In fact one other family in the courtyard offered to share their table.  I love that type of community.  ;;My one complaint would be the beverage options but now I know (and I'm telling you) to byob.  Also remember to bring your cash as it is cash only.

Anyway; after I ate and asked for check; it took about 15 minutes for the check to come and he brought it out and charged me $30 (the all you can eat price). I said no; adding up everything I got; it does not exceed $21. He said he entered it into the system and this price came out cheaper. I said once again that I had seen the prices and there\\'s no way it was more than $21.

Aki, how many ways did I loathe my experience with you? Let me count the ways. ;;1. Your watered down soy sauce. Let's start at the most illustrative and representative point. You couldn't even get your soy sauce right. Never in my life have I complained about the soy sauce. I mean, I feel silly writing this, but in a blind taste test; your soy sauce could not be differentiated between lukewarm sea water with a little bit of regurgitated wasabi in it. If you can't get soy sauce right, you know you are probably in for a wild ride. And boy were we ever. ;;2. For the first time ever, I found multiple bones and gristle (for lack of a better word) in my fish. Having to pull bones and gristle out of my mouth mid-chew didn't jive with my date night feel I was going for. ;;3. Your fish was curiously warm and the texture was concerning. Enough said, this is not high quality or fresh fish by any stretch of the imagination. ;;4. You did not serve me sushi. You served me lukewarm and overaged fished limply draped over a soggy pile of rice. It was like a sad, dying golden retriever putting his head on your knee for the last time before you take him to the vet to be put down. Nothing sadder. On top of that, they don't put wasabi between the fish and the rice. You shouldn't have some yelp reviewer with clearly too much time on his hands teaching you the fundamentals of sushi. ;;5. The service was barely existent. I saw my server 4 times throughout the night, but she was busy, so I blame the same people who re-re-re-refridgerate the fish they serve and not the hard working servers who are understaffed. ;;6. We bought the Groupon, but still feel like I overpaid. I've gone to all you can eat buffets in florida who have sushi the same quality as this place. I saw they do all you can eat sushi, which indicates it's not financially viable to serve high quality fish with this offer, but then everyone suffers, regardless of whether or not we want to participate in this gluttonous act. It's basically failed socialism, with stinky fish. ;;;Bottom line, there are SO SO SO MANY good sushi places in Philly. Most of them cheaper than this place and BYOB.

I mean, the milky fresh mozzarella and soft, yet slightly charred dough certainly never hurt either, but that\\'s to be expected on most pies of this caliber. Even though Nomad\\'s pizza could be considered Neapolitan \"wet\", ironically, the tomato sauce was noticeably still too thin and watery. Other than that, this Spicy Soppressata pick was excellent. ;;Our waitress assured us that their pizzas were single-serve, but I\\'m tellin\\' you, that\\'s aggressive. Even the most ambitious of eaters at our group dinner reluctantly had leftovers. I split the pie with my wife, after ordering a special salad to share as well, and that seemed to be perfect for us. It was a Woodfired Roasted Corn Salad, employing oranges, avocado, cherry tomatoes, shallots, jalapeÃ±os, and fava beans - a nice, refreshing, summery teaser before our spicy, sausage-y main course.;;Also refreshing and recommended, if available, is their special Spiked Shandy Beer Cocktail. Nomad\\'s take on the ale and lemonade favorite uses St. Germaine, tequila, (you guessed it) honey, and (you probably didn\\'t guess it) honey-flavored Shawnee Apiarius beer. Despite this onslaught of alcohols, it was decidedly smooth.;;Now, I know it\\'s summer and sometimes it\\'s nice to keep all the doors open to catch a breeze, but Nomad was hot as balls inside - hotter than outside given how central the wood-burning store is to the dining room.

Let me start by saying the food was good. I had three tacos--Mahi Mahi, pollo, and carnitas.  They were deliciously prepared and the (what I presume to be) homemade sauces provided great extra flavor. They also have Boylan\\'s fountain soda which is really just to die for. ;;And now, the airing of grievances (Seinfeld style):;;1. The tacos are pretty small considering the price (about 4 a pop). I guess that might be so you can sample a selection of the offerings but no one wants to feel they\\'re not getting any bang for their buck. ;;2. It doesn\\'t seem like there\\'s enough seating to accommodate a lunch crowd. The turnover was fast enough and it wasn\\'t an issue for my crew of four but I could def see it being a problem. ;;3. There\\'s at least one discrepancy on the menu (tecate is either $2 everyday or $4.50 depending on where you see it) that annoys me because I think pricing should be straightforward and clear. It just seems to me the error allows for a loophole of charging customers more if they\\'re not looking closely. ;;4.  Lastly, the power situation. While we were there yesterday, there was a power outage. I\\'m in no way blaming that on Buena since it appeared to cover a few blocks in the surrounding area but, the way it was handled by the staff left a lot to be desired. Namely, they just said \"sorry folks\" and watched as diners attempted to wait it out or customers who hadn\\'t placed orders yet filed out. I would\\'ve expected some sort of customer retention effort. After about 10 min of no power (windows allowed plenty of daylight to see), no updates, and increasing heat since the air conditioning was off, we left, too. ;;Take away:: a good option if you\\'re looking for a bite in the area, are not committed to eating in their dining area, and bring your reading glasses.', 'user_id': 'Fr8AbQ5A9TZNxTY7E_wI6w'}\n",

We were nervous walking over but the second we step foot into the beautiful entryway everyone's stress went away. We waited for about 20 minutes and then got sat in the back room where we were able to share one long table and have lots of privacy-- turned out better than we could've expected! Alex was our server and he was friendly and patient with our hungry group; and went thru his favorite cocktails several times for those of us who were indecisive. Our group split the table so half of us split a bunch of small plates and the other half ordered for themselves. Alex was happy to create two separate checks which saved us a lot of time and effort when paying. Cocktails were yummy and strong; food was flavorful (pork gyoza & pork belly buns were awesome apps and the fried rice ROCKED.)

The chirashi was just ok as well as the Taiwanese chicken. The calamari was too breaded and couldn't taste the squid inside, the rolls were too small and the waffle with green tea wasn't good. My friends and I really have NOTHING good to say about the place despite us going over the food/any redeeming factors over and over.;;Now to the finale, this is what happened:;1) Friend notices a mouse in little space between outside and inside door ;2) We get grossed out but took a picture of it and immediately notified the management ;3) Management came over to take a look and ignored it for a good ten mins;4) Some bald guy goes outside with an iPhone (for light) and a FLAME THROWER (the kind you use to melt the top of creme brulee and tries to burn the poor mouse (WHY COULDNT YOU JUST USE A BROOM TO SHOO IT OUT as the first solution instead of trying to light it up?!) ;5) Man lights up the mouse's tail but mouse is too scared to leave (duh);6) Man opens up the door and starts to use a broom and mouse runs back and forth and doesn't go outside bc it's hiding behind the ATM machine;7) Another guy comes out with a broom and tries to shoo it out and still it's not budging.;8) Finally mouse runs and the bald man traps it in the corner with his foot. Then he STOMPS ON IT 3x!!!!!! Instead of holding it with foot and just shoo it with the broom bc he was so pissed.;9) We record all of this and get super grossed out and sad that we thought they killed this little animal unnecessarily;;BUT THERE IS A TWIST AND IT GETS WORSE.;10) Other man tries to sweep mouse out to street and mouse starts trying to run bc it turns out that the mouse was only seriously injured and not dead;11) THE MOUSE IS LITERALLY ON THE STREETS ALREADY, the bald man chases after it and whacks it repeatedly AS HARD AS HE CAN until it's dead.;12) The mouse is dead with its guts on the street now and he sweeps it to the mounds of garbage bags. PURE Brutality? I'm not a mouse lover but this story sounds pretty shitty, right?;;HEY BUT GUESS WHAT THE STORY DOESNT END HERE.;;13) The second man comes into the restaurant and has the NERVE to come over to us and says VERBATIM 'hey, the mouse came from the outside, not the inside. I saw you recording, can you delete...';I CUT HIM OFF right away. I said also verbatim 'what's on our phones is our property and we will do what we wish with it, please give us the check';Ok #1 what makes you think you don't need to apologize for us witnessing all of that? #2 why do you think you can ask us to delete our videos and pictures?! Doesn't even make sense!!!;;THEN ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, they gave us a measly 10% off our bill thinking it'd be ok. We aren't asking for a free meal nor did we ask for any of this but if you're gonna comp anything, 10% is nothing. Please. A measly small apology when we were still at the restaurant before we just left.;;I posted all the pics/videos as soon as we walked out  and have gotten an email from the owner. My friends and I have discussed at full length (like actually 1+ hour) on what to do and we decided that it was best to let the Yelp community what happened.

It seemed a bit dark. We weren\\'t sure if it was supposed to be dark or the result of old oil. However, more alarming than the color was the texture of the chicken. The internal temperature was about 10 lucky seconds past salmonella paranoia-- a bit gamey to say the least. It reminded us of $5 General Tsos from the local Panda Express, minus the Tso Sauce. ;;3) The staff seemed a bit disorganized and may want to consider investing in an electronic reservation system so that each server knows exactly what tables are theirs to focus on. Openable is absurdly expensive but management should totally check out SeatMe by Yelp!;;4) Our server (at least we think she was our server ... it wasn\\'t very clear) came to our table TWICE within our brutally long, 2.5 hour dine-- once to take our orders and once to collect her tips. \"J\" was certainly not her biggest fan; although, to giver her the benefit of the doubt, she didn\\'t seem all that experienced. Either that or she just sucked?;;5) They don\\'t have enough seating for groups of 5 or more, so things were a bit cramped.

The price and the portions were perfect for 5 greedy, broke college students. There wasn\\'t too much rice, and they really loaded on the fresh fish! ;;2) The drinks were sooo yummy!!

There are various \"bubblefish specials\", from which I tried the lavender oolong milk tea. It was delicious, substantial, and the boba was soft and chewy. They also use lactaid milk for their drinks (shout out to all the lactose-intolerant peeps). There are at least 3 pages of drink options to choose from, ranging from oolong teas, black teas, green teas, hot teas, juices, milk shakes, and smoothies. While it was just my first outing, looking at the other drinks from surrounding tables, I was tempted to order more...;;For food, I tried the tonkotsu don, taiwanese beef noodle soup, and a couple of specialty sushi rolls. The tonkotsu don is a helluva dish - you get a big pork cutlet katsu (perfectly crunchy on the outside with juicy meat) upon a bed of white rice sitting in a castiron. Great value meal at $12 and filling. The beef noodle soup was rich and had great flavor. However, they use thin beef slices (which were kind of tough) instead of the traditional beef chunk cubes. The signature sushi rolls have plenty of flavor, mainly because they often come with tempura, some avocado or fruit, and a miso or spicy mayo sauce. ;;Of note, they also have \"Bubblefish boxes\" (around $13-14), which come with a protein teriyaki of your choice, with california roll, shrimp and vegetable tempura, vegetables, and rice.

Menu consists predominantly of pasta and some veal dishes etc No lasagna though. They have specials every day of the week. I loved their free caponata to start. At the suggestions of the waitress I ordered grilled calamari as it is their popular dish, it was ok but nothing to write home about. Fried mozzarella was really good as well as veal porcini. Vegetables cooked just right with slight crunchiness. Gnocchi with asparagus sauce were melting in your mouth and if you are fan of gnocchi you'd love it. Obviously, don't expect it to be healthy, after all it's Italian and sauces are pretty greasy. Generally, I had mixed feelings about that place.

I know it was only an appetizer, but it really was not a lot of food, even for one person.

We ordered 3 large dishes and they were all delicious with small wish for improvements. ;;1) Bossam was delicious - thinly sliced and comes with fresh oysters. The radish kimchi was well seasoned and the salted cabbage was really good too! Overall really fresh ingredients.

The pork was well simmered and tender. The tofu in it was delicious too - firm in shape but tender tasting. One thing that would make it better would be if the kimchi had more texture. The kimchi just broke down - not a slight bit of crunch. But it was really well seasoned - loved the coarse cracked peppers. ;;3) Nakji jeongol - This was my least favorite dish. I think our waiter forgot about us and overcooked it. Nakji (Octopus) is best when it is cooked just the right amount. when overcooked, it becomes tough. And that\\'s what happened to ours - It became tough.

Finally a ramen-centric place in Philly!  This place is pretty new and seems to have some growing pains, but I see a lot of potential.  They're short on staff, which may result in some overlooked order add-ons or a little bit of a wait, but don't let that distract you from a yummy and cheap bowl of noodles.;;While the ramen choices are limited (salt, miso, spicy, and soy sauce), they do come in small and large sizes.  This is great, since I would never be able to finish a large bowl by myself, so having a cheaper and smaller option is great.  You get one less piece of pork belly, but it costs about $1.5 less.  Both the spicy ramen I ordered and soy sauce that my man ordered were pretty good.  The noodles were cooked well and the pork belly was surprisingly tender for how lean it was (diet pork belly, yes!).  My major criticism (and this is a real issue) is that it was a little too shallow on the broth.  I didn't notice either to be too salty, but I like my food over-seasoned.  I also added an egg to my ramen.  The cooks forgot it initially, but brought it out after we alerted them.  The egg was cooked perfectly (medium-boiled), but it did cost about $1.5 extra, so I'm not sure if it's worth it (could order the large for the same total price).;;We also ordered the pork buns, and they seem to use the same pork as in the ramen.  It's lean for pork belly, but again, cooked nice and tender.  They give you two slabs of it per pork bun, so it literally splits the bun open.  It's a bit messy, but I'm not complaining, the more pork the better.  My only complaint is the addition of cucumber slices to the buns.  Maybe I'm biased toward the cucumber-less ways at other eateries, but I do feel that the cucumber gives an overpowering (and not particularly pleasant) taste and texture to the bun.  It interrupted the enjoyment of the pork and doesn't add any additional crunch - which the lettuce supplies.  I took the cucumber out of my last few bites and enjoyed the meaty sweet pork bun much more. ;;I think this place definitely deserves a try and it shouldn't be judged by NYC or West Coast standards.

Their pork buns are on point and more than once they've brought me an extra (free) portion because of how voraciously we devoured them. I generally order their pork ramen; but I've also had the miso and I think both are great options. The seasoned eggs that they prepare are so so good!! I also love their pork belly and often order extra. You can order a large portion for a few dollars extra- do it. It's great to bring some home for leftovers.

Menu is on a chalkboard and hand written on a tiny piece of paper. I like that they offered some unheard of fish, such as Cobia--a whitefish from Florida. My husband ordered that, prepared jerk style with coconut rice. It was good. Not great though. Definitely not $30 great, but I\\'m willing to pay a premium on fish sustainably caught. Maybe I\\'m not used to jerk seasoning but I found it too salty. I ordered the ceviche, with lobster, fluke, and bass I think? And hearts of palm and citrus. For $13 it was a pretty generous portion but it couldve used more kick as I am accustomed to in a ceviche. I also ordered mixed greens (I think it was just bibb lettuce though) in a blood orange vinaigarette. There were blood oranges mixed in, which I love, but the dressing didn\\'t taste citrusy at all. Plus there was absolutely nothing else in the salad, which I found boring and and somewhat lazy. Having to slice my lettuce was also a new experience which was distracting while dining. But at least it was all fresh. We had a small child with us whom they accommodated by halving the halibut meal. My friend had the halibut which looked good, but she didn\\'t comment on. Then the dessert offerings were recited...one chocolate mousse-type selection, and a fruit tart, i believe? My friend opted for the chocolate for us all to split. I will say, it came in a cup that could fit in the palm of your hand, and had some nuts sprinkled on top, but it was more pudding than mousse. She took one bite and I ate the rest. It tasted just fine, but I was surprised that they didn\\'t have something a little more impressive. It was just as good as the chocolate pudding at the Whole Foods salad bar.;All in all, it was a decent, allbeit, very expensive meal.

The seasoning was just right, and we asked for a side of marinara sauce, which was really delicious with the calamari as well. ;;I had the Ravioli Alla Viola (lobster ravioli) for my main dish and enjoyed it. The pink cognac sauce (which is really orange) was delicious and sat well with my tastebuds. The ravioli was also perfectly cooked-- very soft and easy to consume. My boyfriend had the Pollo Gamberi Alla Marsala, which according to him, was very tasteful. This was a healthier dish, as it came with white chicken breast, mushrooms, and tomatoes.

This place seems to cater towards Non-Asians and also attracts undesirables late night. If you order something authentic like Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup or Seafood Pan Fried Noodles; it has no taste and seems like it is flash frozen and microwaved. They just push out their Salt and Pepper Wings; General Tso; and Lo Mein; the typical American Chinese food you can get at your local Chinese spot; which is probably fresher. Also; I would not recommend anyone ordering seafood here. Mai Lei Wa is disgusting; overcrowded; rude staff; and overpriced. Spend your money elsewhere.', 'user_id': '2GgK1Dn-6XF_SaE1iIq92A'}\n",

There are (at least) two dining areas, one upstairs and one downstairs. We were seated downstairs. The room has a nice high ceiling and is generally pretty dimly lit, with alcoves in the stone walls for candles. They have a couple of flatscreens high up on the walls showing black and white films -- I caught bits of two of them while I was there. One was a gangster film and the other seemed to be a Jet Li martial arts thing. Personally, I would expect a bit more of a sword/martial/samurai theme given the name of the restaurant but I really can\\'t complain! Maybe they should show old jidaigeki films on those flatscreens to get a bit more on theme. ;;My friend and I had a coupon from LivingSocial for a seven course tasting menu for two. The coupon described a meal including choices like \"wagyu beef and zento\\'s famous square sushi\", but what we received was very different. The courses were as follows:;;;1. Miso soup with mussels - I am not a fan of miso soup; usually I find the fishy flavor of the dashi to be overpowering. However, this soup was exceptional. The flavors were really well balanced and the mussels were very tasty. ;;2. Calamari Salad - a few rings of deep fried calamari over greens. I liked it.;;3. Crab cakes - two small handmade fried crab cakes. These were pretty plain and could have used a bit more sauce. They tasted fine, but nothing exceptional about it.;;4. White fish carpaccio - three thin slices of white fish very well plated. Delicious and easy on the eyes!;;5. Chicken Teriyaki - a couple of pieces of chicken, sauce, and a small mound of spinach and mushrooms. This dish was by far the most disappointing of the night as it was both small and boring. The greens were more exciting than the chicken. It tasted fine but nothing stood out about it, especially given that this should be an entree course. This is where the advertised Wagyu beef or square sushi should have been.;;6. Sushi platter - Four nigiri sushi (salmon, tuna, white tuna, yellowtail) and half a roll. The sushi was incredible -- by far the best I\\'ve had in Philadelphia (for reference, I have had sushi at Pod, Mizu, Mixx, Aki, Green Garden, and the now defunct Genji). The roll had some sort of mayo based sauce in it (usually a no-no for me) but it was just perfectly balanced. ;;7. Dessert (shared) - Tofu cheesecake and red bean mochi ice cream. This was fine but unexciting. The cheesecake was better than expected but still pretty bland, and the ice cream was good. My girlfriend ordered some Tempura green tea icecream which I stole a bite of -- now THAT was a good dessert! ;;Additionally, the meal came with some non-alcoholic cocktails. I tried a green apple based drink and a white peach based drink, both of which were quite tasty. ;;;Overall it felt like a reasonable value but mainly because of the Livingsocial price. I could see spending $35 plus tax and tip for this meal as a very nice value, but at $70 it would be overpriced.', 'user_id': 'CT2sKLMcL48W1n9M3uKkUA'}\n",

I noticed this young guy walk in with his freind and first thing out of his mouth is \" is this the line your kidding me\" he then procedes to go the front of the line   and starts to talk one of the employees. He then asks his friend if he has $100 which I thought was odd.

He had bribed the kitchen with his $100  to make his order first in front of all the other waiting customers. Naturally I was upset.

I've been to Harper's Garden twice, once for a light dinner and drinks (sitting inside) and once for lunch (sitting outside on huge patio). ;;1st visit: We sat INSIDE for light dinner. The service was fantastic, although at the very end he was kind of slow to bring the check, but overall great throughout the entire night. The cocktails were great, and the beer choices were OK, would like to see some better craft options considering the Philly and Tria reputation for great beer. Our small bites of food were great; I loved the pulled MOZZARELLA with fig, sooo delicious. The feta TOAST and SAUSAGE FLATBREAD were also delicious, although small portions for the price tag. The inside dining area got a tad loud for my liking, voices were echoing loud and it was hard to talk to my friends across the table from me. The 4 of us got 3 drinks each, and 1 small plate of food, and our bill was almost $300. ;;2nd visit: We sat OUTSIDE on the massive, gorgeous outdoor patio. There were 7 of us, on lunch break from the office. The patio is great for conversations with coworkers, because inside was too loud. But the patio got really hot toward the end of our meal, the sun shifted and there wasn't much shade, so we were roasting in our business clothes. Still, it was a beautiful setting for lunch. Their patio is so pretty and well decorated. This visit, the service was super slow. The food itself took nearly 45 minutes to reach our table from the time we ordered, and the server disappeared at the end of the meal when we needed the check. We were 30 minutes late to our office after lunch break. The food was very good (once we finally got it!), I had the SWORDFISH ($20), which I thought was worth the money and very tasty. The portion size was perfect, unlike some of their other plates which are pretty small. The CARROTS Appetizer was amazing! Must try that again, the sauce was delicious. The burger didn't look very big or juicy, but my coworkers ordered that so I don't know how it tasted. For all the food we ordered, I expected a huge bill, but it was only $160 for 7 people (no drinks). ;;Moral of the story: Come here for the best outdoor patio around. Great food, but relatively small plates, so don't come starving or you'll over-order and be broke. Also watch the drink prices, or stick to non-alcoholic, because drinks are not cheap. Best advice: Make a reservation! They are always busy.\", 'user_id': 'CjJhEzdWQNEKa7grwPRQyg'}\n",

The light fixtures and plants in the outside seating create a garden patio feel, which is perfect for summer brunch! The inside decor is just as chic. We waited at the inside bar for about 5 minutes until we were seated at a table outside. After waiting inside though, I feel like you can't go wrong wherever you sit as the entire restaurant is gorgeous. Moving on to the food.;;I ordered from the brunch menu. I started out with a Strawberry Swing from the brunch cocktail section of the menu. It was a mixture of vodka, sparkling rosÃ©, lemon and strawberries. It was perfect for a hot summer's day. I ended up ordering a second round! For my entree, I ordered the Sunny-Side Eggs. It was topped with cheese and served with grilled bread that was toasted to perfection. ;;My overall experience was enjoyable. I would absolutely come back here. There's only a couple, very minor things I would note: 1)The entree serving size is smaller than expected 2) Our waitress had to check with the chef for any entree modifications. Even if it was a minor change such as excluding an ingredient from the dish. Other than that, I would say this place is a perfect addition to the Philly food scene.\", 'user_id': '6SpwwK_x5wYbD1ruAM_D3w'}\n",
